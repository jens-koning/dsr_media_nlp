# Understanding Global News Discourse on Foreign Policy Initiatives

This article examines the competition between China and the United States
through the lens of narrative conflict, focusing on the Digital Silk Road
(DSR). Utilizing topic modelling with BERTopic, the article analyzes global news discourse surround-
ing the DSR to uncover its narratives. Our study reveals polarized views:
Western media often portrays the DSR in the context of strategic competi-
tion and digital authoritarianism, while Chinese media emphasizes its co-
operative benefits. Observers from the Global South, particularly ASEAN
countries, display a balance of cooperative and competitive themes. Through
binomial regression models, we demonstrate that media narratives significantly dif-
fer by region, reflecting the regional political attitudes towards the DSR.
This research contributes to understanding the role of news narratives in
international politics and foreign policy, offering insights into the future
prospects of initiatives like the DSR.
