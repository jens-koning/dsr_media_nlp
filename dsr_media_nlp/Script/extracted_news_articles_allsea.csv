Much focus, of course, has been on how PGII will be an alternative mechanism to China's multitrillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), launched almost 10 years ago as a modern-day Silk Road stretching from East Asia to Europe and Africa. PGII is not exactly new: It is a repackaged version of the Build Back Better World (B3W) initiative the G7 proposed a year ago with the same aim to counter China's growing influence, especially in developing countries. Biden stressed the PGII's tangible and political dimensions when he emphasised that it will not only 'deliver returns for everyone"" but would also allow countries to ""see the concrete benefits of partnering with democracies"". PGII RESPONSE TO EMERGING CHALLENGES LIKE CLIMATE AND ENERGY Why now? At first glance, PGII may look better positioned to respond to emerging challenges of a world that has changed in the near-decade since BRI began. It aims to focus on climate and energy security and the development of soft infrastructure in the digital economy, among other things. Flagship projects include a US$600 million global submarine telecommunications cable connecting Singapore to France through Egypt and the Horn of Africa; a US$40 million investment (and expected to mobilise US$2 billion in further investments) in Southeast Asia's Smart Power Program to accelerate rollout of clean energy technologies; and a US$2 billion solar project in southern Angola.

 The PGII will find a receptive audience in this region, given the ever-growing appetite for infrastructure among Southeast Asian countries. Digital infrastructure is particularly important as a key part of ASEAN's digital masterplan is to technologically transform member states into a digital economy and a digital society by 2025. According to a recent Google-led survey, ASEAN's digital economy is on track to grow to US$1 trillion by 2030, particularly in e-commerce and virtual finance domains. Given Southeast Asia's severe vulnerability to climate change, green infrastructure is another area of interest. ASEAN states signed the 2015 Paris Agreement and its Community Vision 2025 specifically recognised the complementarity between the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and ASEAN's community-building endeavours. South Korean manufacturing giants who have shifted their operations from China in recent years and to other countries, like Vietnam, may also view the PGII investments in a positive light, as it would provide a more favourable business climate and investor outlook. CHINA PIVOT TO DIGITAL AND HEALTH SILK ROAD China's efforts to build and link up road, rail and maritime port connections to facilitate trade in economic corridors are often thought of when it comes to BRI. But lockdowns and border closures in many BRI countries during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a slowdown in infrastructure projects. This accelerated China's pivot from hard to soft infrastructure investment projects, leading to an increase in focus on the Digital Silk Road (DSR), and health diplomacy vis-à-vis the Health Silk Road (HSR). The HSR, interlinked with DSR, has emerged as a vehicle for promoting international development cooperation amid the global pandemic, and is evident in China's involvement in the Middle East and North Africa region through medicine and vaccine diplomacy. 
 


 
 
 The DSR was introduced in 2015 to support the expansion and internationalisation of its technology companies, with investments from the 'development of the digital service sector, such as cross-border e-commerce, smart cities, telemedicine, and internet finance,' to accelerating 'technological progress including computing, big data, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, blockchain and quantum computing.' A key aspect of Beijing's technological cooperation with Southeast Asian countries is in information and telecommunication technologies (ICT). Through the DSR, Beijing has invested in ICT-focused telecommunications and digital infrastructure, as well as fibre optic terrestrial and submarine cable networks in this region.  CAN G7 PARTNERSHIP COUNTER BELT AND ROAD? Both initiatives will face challenges in governance and navigating local regulations in recipient countries. Here, the Chinese approach may work in the BRI's favour. As one of Chinese President Xi Jinping's most ambitious international projects, BRI benefits from the straightforward processes of a strong central government in terms of policies and resources. But in practice, Chinese players have encountered challenges on the ground, and have had to become more sensitive and adaptable to local conditions and more mindful of local politics. The increased capital investments can have enormous consequences on the host countries, including exacerbating competition among power elites on a micro-level. On the flip side, the Western approach to investments which tends towards more formalistic application of a uniform set of rules at the three levels of international or bilateral cooperation, domestic regulation and private transactions could end up a strength, as it lends potential to building a more uniform and common approach to global infrastructure standards financed by PGII. 
 
 Without the same top-down structures as BRI, PGII will need to mobilise both public and private resources across seven countries. This could get messy though it is yet unclear how G7 nations will share the risks and responsibilities and agree on the metrics for measuring success. Equally important to the issue of whether the PGII will be a primarily US-led initiative or a G7 (though US-fronted) affair, is the issue of optics. At a time where American primacy appears to be in decline, the PGII will serve to facilitate the US' soft power projection abroad. HEALTHY COMPETITION? It is too early to tell if PGII can counter BRI as a contrasting model of development. But as PGII pushes to gain ground, BRI will not stand still either. Competition heating up may be very well what is needed to incentivise Beijing to push for more reforms, to strengthen the quality of existing investment projects and to reform institutions and policies in two particular areas - emerging technologies and green financing. Through its China Standards 2035, Beijing has ambitions to set global standards for emerging technologies in areas such as artificial intelligence and advanced communications technology. For Beijing, the BRI has served as a conduit for making its own companies more competitive against American and other rivals internationally, particularly in the area of technology standards. 
 
 Another example is the Green Development Finance (GDF), developed by the Belt and Road Initiative International Green Development Coalition (BRIGC). The GDF's primary goal is to encourage Chinese financiers and infrastructure developers to voluntarily select BRI projects with low environmental risks. The emergence of PGII may very well yield positive dividends for global governance, the outcomes which may not necessarily lead to a further bifurcation of the world in terms of bipolar opposites. Instead, it has the potential to pave the way for more sustainable infrastructural development.

It provides vast opportunities and geographic reach to both established businesses and new enterprises. On a macro level, ecommerce is reshaping global trade. The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of ecommerce and digital transformation. Consumers have resorted to ecommerce to meet their shopping needs. As a result, ecommerce has become an important factor in domestic markets – supply and distribution of goods and services increasingly revolve around ecommerce. This is seen particularly in the rise of the gig economy – ehailing and delivery services have benefited greatly despite business closures and rising unemployment. Businesses that adopted ecommerce are also better equipped to mitigate the impact of lockdown. Ecommerce has brought new opportunities, but also brought to light the importance of addressing existing barriers. As international trade has promoted economic growth and exchanges between countries in the past, today ecommerce also provides opportunities for greater cooperation and economic growth between China and Malaysia. Ecommerce in Malaysia The Malaysian government has attempted to facilitate digitalisation with the myDigital initiative and Malaysia Digital Economy Blueprint. The government sees digital economy as an important contributor to the nation economy, and it has focused on accelerating the country's progress through digitalisation, while ensuring that no Malaysian gets left behind. In the private sector, ecommerce platforms like Lazada, Grab and Shopee enabled small businesses, and even micro-businesses, to open with minimal start-up costs and compete in global markets. Even though ecommerce in Malaysia is relatively robust, room for improvement remains. Challenges exist in adoption of new digital tools, cybersecurity threats, digital marketing skills, restricted production capacity, high logistic cost, and absence of knowledge regarding market access and rules in cross-border ecommerce. Other barriers include broadband services, overreliance on cash, lack of consumers' trust, poor digital skills among the population, and lack of government support. International standards can play in enhancing national digital resilience and building trust in ecommerce. In this, concrete initiatives are needed, such as ecommerce willingness assessments and strategy formulation, information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure and services, access to financing for ecommerce, ecommerce skills development, and empowering entrepreneurs in developing countries. What China has done in ecommerce, and how Malaysia can learn from it. Leading Internet corporations are growing their ecommerce arm and mobile payment services, especially in and South and Southeast Asia. Alibaba has been setting up logistic centres in key markets, including Malaysia. Merger and acquisition activity also increasingly emphasise collaboration with local companies to speedup incorporation. This has been reinforced by a rise in ecommerce free trade areas. Cross-border ecommerce is a significant part of China's Internet Plus strategy. It reflects online sales as an effective way of boosting consumption, as well as its growing contribution in regional value chains, especially among SMEs and in the agricultural sector. This is further aided by fintech projects by AliPay and WeChat Pay, China's foremost epayment service providers. Alibaba's subsidiary Ant Financial has followed a similar strategy, obtaining shares of fintech companies, such as in the Philippines (Mynt), Malaysia (Touch ‘n Go), and India (PayTM). Malaysia was the first country to host an eWTP (Electronic World Trade Platform) hub outside of China. Ecommerce entrees require guidance on setting up online stores and digital marketing strategies. Incubator programs play an important role to help grow these aspiring entrepreneurs. Malaysia can learn from China's ecommerce development by keeping pace with the latest trend and innovations, engaging experts to further improve the local ecommerce ecosystem and apply big data to understand consumer demand. There is also room for Malaysia to benefit from China's untapped internet market potential, as 45% of the Chinese population still lack internet access. How the BRI helps ecommerce The ecommerce push in the BRI-participating economies saw Alibaba and JD.com providing a platform for less-developed economies to access consumer goods from supermarket chains and shopping malls. The Digital Silk Road (DSR) has progressed into improving recipient countries' telecommunications networks and digital technologies, including AI capabilities, cloud computing, ecommerce, and other digital economic areas. Projects in telecommunications, ecommerce and other forms of innovative technology applied to smart cities have benefited as a result. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, in May, promised to accelerate the construction of new infrastructure such as 5G networks and data centres. Haitong Securities predicts new infrastructure investments will total RMB17.5 trillion (or US$2.47 trillion) in the next five years, or roughly RMB3.0 trillion on average yearly. The new infrastructure investment will have spillover benefits for governments and firms along the Belt and Road, which often receive low-interest soft loans from state banks to purchase Chinese tech products. China and economies cooperating with it under the BRI are an increasingly significant part of the world economy. The digital BRI could boost China's export of digital surveillance technologies to countries as part of the war against Covid-19, especially in implementing contact tracing. While 5G rollout and China's surveillance equipment sales tend to dominate headlines, the significance of information and communications technology to economic growth and development should not be overlooked. Investments in digital infrastructure could aid economic recovery by increasing demand and generating employment, and in the long run, drive economic transformation by enhancing output and trade in goods and services.

4;China's Digital Silk Road Initiative: A Boon for Developing Countries or a Danger to Freedom?;;2020-12-17 07:15:00;timezone unknown;https://thediplomat.com/2020/12/chinas-digital-silk-road-initiative-a-boon-for-developing-countries-or-a-danger-to-freedom/;thediplomat.com;Some observers worry that it will equip authoritarian governments with next-generation surveillance technologies.;"AdvertisementAs part of China's massive Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Beijing launched the Digital Silk Road (DSR) in 2015 with a loose mandate. It has since become a significant part of Beijing's overall BRI strategy, under which China provides aid, political support, and other assistance to recipient states. DSR also offers support to Chinese exporters, including many well-known Chinese technology companies. The DSR assistance goes toward improving recipients' telecommunications networks, artificial intelligence capabilities, cloud computing, e-commerce and mobile payment systems, surveillance technology, smart cities, and other high-tech areas.China has already signed agreements on DSR cooperation with, or provided DSR-related investment to, at least sixteen countries. But the true number of agreements and investments is likely much larger, because many of these go unreported: memoranda of understanding (MOUs) do not necessarily show whether China and another country have embarked upon close cooperation in the digital sphere. Some estimates suggest that one-third of the countries participating in BRI — 138 at this point — are cooperating on DSR projects.Leaders of many developing countries have signed DSR agreements. Although these MOUs are not legally binding, they show the scope of global interest in DSR. Countries in Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia desperately need inexpensive, high-quality technology to expand wireless phone networks and broadband internet coverage. DSR-related investments can help fill that gap and spark growth by providing critical infrastructure. Chinese firms are bringing additional benefits to developing countries by establishing training centers and research and development programs to boost cooperation between scientists and engineers, and to transfer technical knowledge in many areas.Still, some democracies have raised serious concerns about the Digital Silk Road. They worry that, at a time when Beijing is becoming more assertive globally, China will use DSR to enable recipient countries to adopt its model of technology-enabled authoritarianism. Chinese technology companies have already helped governments in other countries develop surveillance capabilities that could be used against opposition groups, and Beijing has provided training for interested DSR recipient countries on how to monitor and censor the internet. Although some of these Chinese companies are nominally private, even the private firms have drawn global scrutiny for state links as they are required by Chinese cybersecurity legislation to store data on servers in China and submit to checks from authorities.Moreover, allowing Chinese firms to build countries' fifth-generation (5G) networks and other infrastructure, and to set technology standards, could risk espionage and coercion of other states' politics if Beijing used data breaches to blackmail political elites in those states. DSR could also help recipient countries better control their internets through filtering, content moderation, data localization, and surveillance. Doing so might accelerate a fracturing of the global internet, as some countries pursue these policies of internet control while others remain committed to internet freedoms.Enjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.Silk Road Surveillance Looking at examples of countries where the DSR has already progressed can offer clues about both its positive and negative aspects. Take Ecuador, for instance. Ecuador has participated in the Digital Silk Road in several ways. It has worked with China on a smart cities program designed to reduce crime. This system relies on footage from more than four thousand Chinese-made cameras installed throughout the country. Following the system's installation, the cameras will likely have facial recognition capabilities. In addition, several Ecuadorean hospitals have begun using artificial intelligence-enabled COVID-19 diagnostic tools developed by the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei.NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
Although the installation of the surveillance cameras coincided with a drop in crime rates across Ecuador, camera footage, initially thought to be sent to the police, is also being sent to the country's domestic intelligence agency. In the past, the agency has regularly tracked and intimidated political opponents. In addition, Chinese investment in the country has been implicated in multiple high-profile corruption cases, as well as a significant debt to China. Ecuador has sought to renegotiate its debt with Beijing and has also agreed to export 80 percent of its crude oil to China to repay some of its debts.AdvertisementIn other countries, like Egypt, concerns about the DSR are more about the possibility that it will play a role in exporting a controlled type of domestic internet. China has courted North Africa and the Middle East as part of its technology push; it reportedly has signed Digital Silk Road memoranda of understanding with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. Cooperation has moved quickly with Egypt. In 2019, Egyptian officials visiting China met leaders of ten major Chinese firms to discuss increasing investment in areas including artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and telecommunications infrastructure. Huawei has built a cloud computing center in Egypt, and China is increasing financing to Egypt's telecommunications sector.Egypt desperately needs to upgrade its crumbling infrastructure and gain access to inexpensive 5G. But Chinese technical assistance could enhance the Egyptian government's ability to crack down on internet freedoms. In recent years, Beijing has held training for Egyptian officials on censorship; such training could have provided an impetus for Egypt to adopt a 2018 cybercrime law that moves the country closer to China's internet model. The law expands the government's ability to censor online information and punish those who publish or even access certain information.Or, the DSR could help authoritarian leaders stay in power in other ways. Zambia has cooperated on Digital Silk Road projects with China, particularly in upgrades to Zambia's wireless networks. Huawei is building Zambia's 5G network, as it is in many countries across Africa. Huawei has also built the data center that stores and processes the Zambian government's data.  But as Zambia, once a democratic success story in southern Africa, slides toward authoritarianism, its technology cooperation with China could further empower Zambia's rulers. Huawei reportedly has provided technology to help the Zambian government spy on political opponents — a situation reportedly repeated in Uganda, where Huawei has helped the government monitor political rivals. But concerns about China's influence in Zambia are likely being suppressed; the government of President Edgar Lungu has also worked to censor and discourage criticism of China in Zambian media outlets.Some democracies also worry that DSR projects could help the Chinese government gain access to sensitive data. While U.S. officials have pressured central and east European states not to use Chinese companies to build telecommunications and other infrastructure, Serbia has tried to balance between the U.S. and China. Although European countries have agreed upon a plan to limit Huawei's penetration, Serbia has welcomed Huawei's assistance in upgrading its digital infrastructure.Both the U.S. government and some European states worry that the Chinese government could obtain backdoor access to data on Huawei networks in Serbia. A secret backdoor for Chinese intelligence, and possibly the Chinese military, would be especially concerning to European states; Serbia has close links with the EU. Probably to assuage the U.S., the Serbian government has committed to Washington that it will prohibit the use of 'untrusted' 5G providers, which the White House surely intends to mean Huawei. Yet the Serbian government has given no indication that it actually intends to ban Huawei from its 5G network.Forging on with the DSR These existing Digital Silk Road deals are just the start. Beijing is making DSR a bigger foreign policy priority, as the United States, Australia, Japan, and some European states ban Chinese tech firms from their 5G infrastructure and launch broader strategies to limit Chinese tech giants' expansion. Chinese technology firms therefore need even greater growth in developing markets if they are excluded from wealthier states.Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.The coronavirus pandemic, which has led many governments to monitor their populations, has only added to the demand in developing states for Chinese telecommunications and surveillance tools. Beijing has linked DSR to the Health Silk Road, a subset of the BRI that supports health infrastructure.But as DSR expands, concerns about its influence on recipient states will likely mount as well. Some developing countries, such as India, have expressed similar qualms as the U.S. and Europe about China's tech offensive. Beijing's increasingly nationalist diplomacy is also undermining its efforts to assuage policymakers in developing states about the potential downsides of DSR and BRI.To be sure, China is not the only country whose major tech companies have participated in surveillance, cooperation with their countries' militaries, and espionage abroad. Some U.S. tech giants have also used their networks to facilitate surveillance, espionage, and defense operations. U.S. companies such as Gatekeeper Systems also have sold facial recognition technology to authoritarian states such as Saudi Arabia. And, regardless of China's actions, many governments have clear demands for surveillance and artificial intelligence, as well as other technologies that raise privacy concerns.AdvertisementDespite questions raised about aspects of DSR, Beijing will keep pushing forward. China has already spent an estimated $79 billion on DSR-related projects, and its DSR assistance will likely grow substantially throughout the 2020s. At major China-sponsored international summits such as the World Internet Conference, Beijing has promoted DSR as a priority.As the Digital Silk Road expands, the conflicts around it — between countries signing up for DSR and those concerned about its downsides and between groups within countries worried about its detrimental effects and some governments that stand to benefit — will only intensify.Joshua Kurlantzick is Senior Fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations.This article is excerpted from a new CFR Interactive on the Digital Silk Road, which can be accessed here.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat-2020-12-15-1.jpg;False;;42.865353;81bcb48fb068dfc68ec4913c417baf95;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND DSR', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}
5;China's Digital Silk Road and the Global Digital Order;Richard Ghiasy and Rajeshwari Krishnamurthy;2021-04-13 12:39:00;full;https://thediplomat.com/2021/04/chinas-digital-silk-road-and-the-global-digital-order;thediplomat.com;China's Digital Silk Road is an ambitious vision to catalyze global digitalization. What will it mean for digital governance?;"AdvertisementChina's Digital Silk Road (DSR) was launched in 2015 as a component of Beijing's vast vision for global connectivity, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Like the BRI, the DSR is not monolithic and involves many actors at all levels across the Chinese public and private sectors. It is amorphous and the line between official and unofficial DSR projects is often blurry. Comprehensive data on DSR investments is difficult to come by. According to one estimate, by 2018, DSR-related investments in digital infrastructure projects outside of China had reached $79 billion.The DSR aims to improve digital connectivity in participating countries, with China as the main driver of the process. On the macro level, the DSR is about the development and interoperability of critical digital infrastructure such as terrestrial and submarine data cables, 5G cellular networks, data storage centers, and global satellite navigation systems. In one of the most recent moves, China completed the launch of its global satellite system, BeiDou, which, in some regions, is more accurate than the United States' global positioning system (GPS). In Asia, Pakistan, Laos, Brunei, and Thailand are among the countries that have adopted BeiDou, and there is growing use in West Asia (the Middle East) and Africa. At the micro level, the DSR promotes connectivity between local businesses and consumers and among businesses and consumers. Examples include e-commerce, taxi-hailing, fintech (financial technology), and edtech (education technology) platforms and apps, as well as hardware such as routers, smartphones, and PCs.What Drives the DSR?The DSR is far more than just an infrastructure project. For China, the DSR is a solution that engenders a less U.S.-centric and a more Sino-centric Asian and global digital order. China pursues this goal by enabling the opening of new markets for Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Huawei, and by strengthening the world's digital connectivity with China.The DSR fits right in with the Chinese authorities' ambitious national goals such as 'Made in China 2025' and 'China Standards 2035.' These initiatives aim to enhance China's domestic tech innovation, production, and transaction capabilities. In turn, these goals are part of an overarching vision of the Chinese government for tech primacy and greater autonomy in the global digital order.Enjoying this article?

The DSR aids Chinese tech giants and smaller players to boost their sales and local knowhow and gain a foothold in overseas markets – often with the help of Chinese government policy facilitation. Regardless of what one makes of the approach, the DSR expands the oligopolistic pool of digital products and services suppliers.NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
Indeed, a small number of actors lead the tech world, and U.S. tech giants Alphabet (Google), Intel, Amazon, Cisco, and Facebook in particular have a near-global monopoly in their respective domains. For example, by the end of 2018, content providers such as Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon owned or leased more than half of the undersea cable bandwidth. These cables carry close to 98 percent of international internet data and telephone traffic. Such dominance is not healthy and several actors, including the EU and Australia, have taken steps to curb these tech giants' sway.AdvertisementThe DSR often focuses on BRI participants and developing economies; but the DSR's reach is not limited to these actors. The initiative fills digital 'voids' wherever it spots one. Top recipients of DSR investments even include large European economies such as Germany and Italy. In Europe, projects focus on 5G networks, fintech, and smart city technologies. Through competitive Chinese public-private sector partnership deals, the DSR catalyzes a more digitalized world from Serbia to Mexico to Myanmar. A more digitalized world is not exclusively beneficial to China and Chinese companies. Indeed, DSR digitalization, if accompanied by economic growth, could offer a host of spinoff investment and sales opportunities for non-Chinese tech and non-tech companies too.But There Are Significant ChallengesAs with any initiative of this scale, the DSR comes with some challenges. Particularly, these apply to existing tech giants and digital infrastructure providers who would wish to sustain their lead. Broadly, however, these challenges apply to all stakeholders who favor the vision of a more open, transparent, free, and equitable global cyber domain – and digital governance at large.In this regard, the DSR has four significant and far-reaching strategic implications. First, China can build and offer digital backbones that are almost entirely homegrown. The backbones are the infrastructure that makes digital communication possible, such as data cables, cellular networks, and data storage centers. Drawing an analogy with Legos, the more backbone China builds, the more it can build on and connect to that foundation – thus strengthening its position in the global digital order.Second, the DSR may facilitate China to set standards for digital infrastructure and next-generation tech such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, blockchain, serverless computing, and so on. Although all tech leaders seek to set standards, existing tech leaders are bound to view emerging Chinese attempts to set standards as competition. Beyond the considerations of existing tech leaders and within the wider global considerations, setting standards brings considerable strategic advantages with it. Moreover, the DSR creates digital arteries that are likely to boost Chinese supply chains, its economy, and, therefore, its overall global economic influence.Third, China's view on digital governance has a much more state-paternalistic nature. This differs starkly from the average liberal Western view on digital values and norms, especially that of the United States. The Chinese government enforces strict restrictions on the cyberspace in China. It also does not hesitate to closely monitor its netizens in a considerably sealed off domestic 'intranet.' Granted, China is certainly not the only country to practice a restrictive view on digital governance, and different countries enforce different types and levels of restrictions over cyberspace. Countries like Singapore and India tend to enforce controls on content too, and the EU, for instance, is increasingly regulating content. So, while the DSR does not promote a liberal and transparent cyber domain per se, it is important to note that there are no universal global cyber governance values. Perhaps this is reflective of the diversity of cultures and socio-political values on the human canvas – both online and offline.Fourth, Chinese businesses, and by extension, Chinese authorities, could gain access to large local data pools through the DSR. By strengthening other countries' reliance on Chinese infrastructure, Beijing could – theoretically – gain a valuable tool of local political influence, although this would depend considerably on local cybersecurity policies and enforcement capacities, among other factors. Such potential exploitation, however, is not exclusive to China. As the Edward Snowden revelations and the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal showed, any tech provider or cyber tech-advanced actor could abuse their position, if so desired.Enjoying this article?

It also challenges the existing dominance of the U.S. digital value system and dominant market share of its tech companies. As such, the DSR presents both serious partners in digital transformation for those countries in need of competitively priced digital products and services, as well as competition to existing tech leaders. Regardless of where one stands, amidst a pandemic that has wreaked havoc on the global economy, digitalization and economic growth are as welcome as ever.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;['Richard Ghiasy and Rajeshwari Krishnamurthy'];https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat-network-3524352_1280.jpg;False;;37.122536;8d768c342fbfaac41ab34e9c79b52ffe;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND DSR', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}
6;For Indonesia, Chinese 5G Cooperation Brings Promise and Peril;Sebastian Strangio;2021-01-20 13:04:43;full;https://thediplomat.com/2021/01/for-indonesia-chinese-5g-cooperation-brings-promise-and-peril;thediplomat.com;Like many nations, Indonesia faces a difficult decision about how far to engage with China's Digital Silk Road.;AdvertisementEarlier this month, on his four-nation tour of Southeast Asia, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Indonesia, during which the two sides discussed cooperation on the development of 5G networks in the archipelago.Under the leadership of Xi Jinping, China has stepped up its global engagement in a host of economic and political domains. An important part of this is positioning China as a global technological leader, which has taken place under the aegis of the Digital Silk Road (DSR) a major pillar of the Belt and Road Initiative that was established in 2013.The DSR is has the aim of expanding China's digital connections abroad and thus increasing its commercial and political influence.The telecommunications firm Huawei is one of China's mainstays in its DSR push, helping to develop  5G networks in various countries, including Indonesia. Since 2009, Huawei has invested $600 million in research for the development of 5G technology globally. In more recent years, it has also offered to help governments build their 5G networks, an offer made attractive by the fact that its technology is much more affordable than competing products produced by Western firms.NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter However, several countries have also boycotted collaboration with Huawei on 5G due to concerns about national security, including the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Britain, and Canada. In addition, France and Japan have also indirectly prohibited the use of technology assembled by Huawei.Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.In Indonesia, however, the country has welcomed with open arms both the arrival of Huawei and of the DSR more broadly. Last year, Huawei announced that it was collaborating with the country's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT). The government of President Joko Widodo views collaboration between Huawei and Indonesia's technology industry, government, and universities as central to achieving its goal of producing a creative and digital economy by 2035 and a 'more developed' nation by 2045.This collaboration currently takes place in three fields: artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 5G networks. On the first two counts, Huawei is involved in developing BPPT's capacity and helping the agency develop and apply AI and cloud computing in the Indonesian economy.However, the government in Jakarta is still unsure of Indonesia's readiness to make the leap to 5G technology, the Head of Human Resources Development Research, Basuki Yusuf Iskandar recently told the local media.AdvertisementIskandar believes that before Indonesia can build a 5G network, it must take into account several factors beyond the basic technological challenges: namely, whether Indonesia's industry and regulatory capacities, as well as the population as a whole, are ready to make the transition. He added that if this readiness is lacking, the implementation of this 5G network will not bring the expected economic returns.To assist with this, Huawei is helping prep the 5G market in Indonesia in several ways. First, the company is helping to educate the public about 5G technology and its potential benefits. Muhammad Rosidi, Huawei's national ICT strategy and marketing director in Indonesia, stated recently that the firm has played an important role in disseminating information about 5G and its potential benefits to the Indonesian public. Huawei is also ready to help accelerate the digitalization of infrastructure in Indonesia, specifically by helping develop the capacity of government workers.Second, Huawei last year also began collaborating with the Indonesian Presidential Staff Office to put 100,000 Indonesian officials through a five-year vocational training course in digital literacy. Third, Huawei also pledged to develop infrastructure such as band transceiver stations, or towers, that can facilitate wireless communication in various regions so that 5G technology can be accessed evenly across the Indonesian islands.China's interest in implementing the DSR in Indonesia is not surprising, given that the country has the sixth-largest internet user base in the world. This gives Chinese companies like Huawei added motivation for making Indonesia a priority market, including on 5G infrastructure development.As this cooperation advances, however, Indonesia's embrace of the DSR raises some concerns. Despite Huawei's efforts, questions remain around equality of access to 5G technology, given that the present internet infrastructure is still not developed equally across the country..There is also a worry that DSR will allow China to surveil the Indonesian government, or that the latter will use Chinese technologies to spy on its own people. It is crucial to note that firms from China have already assisted governments in some parts of the world with developing surveillance capabilities that could be used against dissidents and opposition groups. China has also helped train foreign government officials on how to monitor and censor the internet.As for Indonesia, it has signed with China a memorandum of understanding on boosting internet security and tech cooperation, the first such agreement signed between China and a foreign countryEnjoying this article?

Credit: AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, FileAdvertisement'New Value Together' was the slogan for the 40th annual GITEX Technology Week, the only in-person global technology show of 2020 held December 6 to 10 at the Dubai World Trade Center. Its organizer is known across the Middle East – particularly the GCC countries – as the region's leader in 5G and cloud computing: Huawei.The global telecoms supplier and mobile phone manufacturer made headlines throughout 2020 – most recently in Southeast Asia with a blitz of deals monopolizing Indonesia's 5G network – for its role in a growing global 5G movement. Eleven telecom firms including those in the Gulf Cooperation countries (GCC) of the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Oman have signed massive 5G contracts with Huawei over the last year.By 2025, GCC countries will house much of the world's growing 5G subscribers. Huawei has jumped on the bandwagon to capitalize on what they perceive as a promising future for 5G in the Middle East. The company's leadership has been bullish on the Middle East since September 2019. And the region's $164 billion annual market for information and communication technology (ICT) products is a good reason for Huawei's enthusiasm. Over the last year, there has been a surge in publicly administered cloud services in the Gulf worth nearly $3 billion. This Gulf government-led push is confirming for Huawei that 5G-enabled cloud computing in the GCC is an increasingly lucrative market.But what impact has this recent growth in 5G had on the everyday lives of the 54 million people living in the GCC? Not much. Locally, 5G is mostly being implemented widely only insofar as to enable a more rapid pace of downloads to smartphones and quicker analog communications. As of December 1, Huawei's new P40 PRO 5G phone is available for consumer purchase in the UAE. But analysts remain optimistic on the potential of 5G to positively impact multiple industries in the GCC, specifically energy usage optimization, cloud computing, ultrafast broadband, and internet of things (IoT) innovation, including self-driving cars, transportation, and factory equipment.In response, Huawei has been relentlessly extending its digital footprint across the Middle East despite Western efforts to curtail its global expansion. The United States has repeatedly expressed security concerns over Huawei's presence in international markets. Since 2018, U.S. policymakers have been actively attempting to hinder the company and its China-side competitor ZTE's expansion abroad, especially within the European Union. The Trump administration's pressure on Huawei – specifically its recent ploy to curb critical semiconductor technology sales to the Chinese company – has sparked global discussions about data privacy and security-related drawbacks to international reliance on Huawei's toolkit.Enjoying this article?

This is perhaps due to the region's highly sensitive position in geopolitics. Given a heavy reliance on China's oil market as well as the significant U.S. military and diplomatic presence, there is no incentive for Gulf economies to become a proxy war zone for the world's two largest superpowers.But COVID-19 has made Gulf economies increasingly reliant on China as the nation's economy recovers faster than the United States' from the global recession. Since COVID-19 restrictions lifted in China, Chinese policymakers have undertaken major steps to develop what they are calling 'industrial internet' of global telecommunications providers at far cheaper prices than their Western competitors in the sector. Saudi Telecom Company (STC) reported a jump of over 1,000 percent in bandwidth due to the surge in remote education. They are currently scrambling to secure necessary network infrastructure to keep pace with the demands of Saudi's ambitious Vision 2030 strategy. Similarly, Qatar is preparing to host in 2022 what it hopes will be the first 5G World Cup.

Huawei's aforementioned growth in global 5G has occupied much of the 2020 conversation on Chinese companies comprising China's Digital Silk Road (DSR) initiative. The phrase DSR was initially launched in a government white paper in 2015 as an extension of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a global strategy for Chinese-led infrastructure development. Now the DSR is a widely used moniker for Chinese data and telecoms activity abroad. According to Fudan University, the DSR policy itself is comprised of five key aspects: with infrastructure at its core, the DSR relies on expanding influence to trade, finance, and 'people's hearts,' all geared toward shaping policies abroad. These include cybersecurity, digital governance, and data sharing practices across the developing world.AdvertisementBoth the BRI and DSR act in practice as catch-all monikers for economic and policy decisions that Chinese government actors and corporations make. The ambiguity of DSR's branding makes potentially disparate policies across many Chinese companies – each with varying levels of Chinese government involvement – look cohesive. Even within those companies China's hybridized structure of state-owned and private enterprises makes top-level decision-making incentives difficult for outsiders to disentangle.No single company or government entity is totally emblematic of China's DSR, even Huawei. But U.S. 5G operations are still lagging behind that of Asia in the Middle East. The Japan Center for Economic Research predicts that given its performance in light of COVID-19, the Chinese economy will surpass that of the United States before 2030. With rollout of 5G in the U.S. lagging in pace behind that of Asia, Huawei and its peer companies' current moves into Middle Eastern markets could chart a course for Asian dominance in the region's future.Multinational coordination efforts – such as the digital infrastructure partnership launched last year between the EU and Japan – are a positive strategy for the U.S. government's competition to stay relevant on 5G. Republican Chairman of the U.S. Senate's Foreign Relations Committee Jim Risch recently released a report hoping to form a transatlantic partnership between the EU and U.S., citing concerns over the vast capacity for Chinese controlled firms to support data storage. Just like Huawei's 'New Value Together' slogan in the Middle East, cooperation strategies may help the West stay relevant and bring increasingly competitive value to the Middle Eastern ICT market.Sophie Zinser is a researcher focusing on China's role in the Middle East, South and Central Asia.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;Sophie Zinser;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat-2020-12-15-12.jpg;False;;32.88938;afe66583a5b3a536980c52e2ae9a296a;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND DSR', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

In this competition, the United States and China are the front-runners, with both countries surging forward based on their respective competitive advantages: the U.S. has cutting-edge hardware, research, and talent, while China has a massive trove of the AI-ready data that fuels technological development, and a strong political will to succeed.The dominance of these two countries in the tech sector undoubtedly has strategic implications for Southeast Asia, which predominantly relies on importing and using AI technology from the U.S. and China. What are the implications of choosing the technology of one country over the other? Will Southeast Asian countries face problems related to digital colonization and national sovereignty?Some scholars have described Southeast Asia as a testing ground and a gateway for China's expansion as a superpower. Indeed, China is increasingly regarded by Southeast Asians as the most influential economic power in the region and, to a lesser extent, the most influential politically and strategically.China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a trillion-dollar international infrastructure program spanning nearly 140 countries, is part of its plan to increase its global influence. An important part of the BRI is its reach into the digital space through the Digital Silk Road (DSR). The DSR's key components – 5G technologies, massive data centers, investments in AI, and satellite navigation systems – have major implications for data privacy, national security, and the global governance of cyberspace. Observers have expressed concerns about cyber espionage and cybersecurity, as these technological advances would give the Chinese government the ability to access, analyze, and exploit in real-time the large data sets of BRI recipient countries. Additionally, think tanks and scholars have warned of China 'exporting authoritarianism,' 'exporting political illiberalism,' or pushing 'authoritarian capitalism' globally through the distribution of Chinese technologies.NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
Discussions about the geopolitical risks of China achieving global dominance in AI paint the power struggle between the U.S. and China as a showdown between liberal democracy and digital authoritarianism. However, while the U.S. is often considered as a more benign force, worries about the Chinese state's overreach apply and overlap significantly in the case of the U.S.Enjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.The 2013 revelations of Edward Snowden, a former contractor to the U.S. intelligence agencies, laid bare the impressive breadth and depth of Washington's global surveillance capabilities and cyber espionage practices. A particularly powerful example is the PRISM program, which enables the routine mass collection of data from major big tech companies. But while these revelations shook the world, privacy concerns regarding AI-enabled automated mass surveillance remain unaddressed.In the discourse on the geopolitics of AI, some scholars have taken the theoretical lens of digital or data colonization to analyze the position of the Global South, listing the ways in which algorithms can be used to oppress, exploit, and dispossess vulnerable populations.However, experts and academics in the AI field interviewed for EngageMedia's recent study on AI governance in Southeast Asia pointed out that focusing on national sovereignty distracts us from seeing the matter holistically, as a complex interplay of state and market forces working together and against each other.AdvertisementWhile the respondents acknowledged that data predominantly flows toward China and the U.S., and that Southeast Asia's dependency on technologies coming from the two AI superpowers may disadvantage the nations of the region, some experts said that the exploitation of data would occur with or without the involvement of foreign companies. They noted that since Southeast Asia's data protection regulations are either weak or non-existent, similar harms from misusing data collection would arise in any event with local players.It is therefore more important to focus on creating a strong regulatory and policy foundation locally, so that data protection and technology usage do not merely rely on the ethics or goodwill of the owners of the technologies, whether they be American, Chinese, or from another nation.It is also important to recognize that Southeast Asian countries have the agency to choose the technologies that they use and to negotiate for favorable terms. Some respondents in the study alluded to this when asked about the implications of the U.S.-China tech rivalry; their position was that Southeast Asian states would decide what is best for their countries, whether in terms of price and functionality, or from a strategic point of view.For example, a case study on Alibaba's activities in Malaysia (which includes a Digital Free Trade Zone and Alibaba's City Brain smart cities program) argues that Malaysia derives real economic and infrastructural benefits from working with Alibaba, geopolitical and privacy concerns notwithstanding. The study concluded that other countries 'desperately need to improve the quality of their game in Southeast Asia,' and that 'railing against Chinese government-dominated initiatives and the DSR is not an adequate strategy.'A study from Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute on 5G adoption in the region shows that countries in Southeast Asia display different levels of trust toward China, with Laos and Cambodia having the highest preference for Chinese providers, versus the Philippines, Vietnam, and Singapore with the lowest. While trust toward China was higher in 2019, telecommunications providers in the region appear to have diversified their vendor selection in 2020, following U.S. restrictions on Chinese technologies. At the moment, Nokia (Finland) and Ericsson (Sweden), alongside Huawei and ZTE (both China) are the biggest players in the 5G landscape in Southeast Asia, with U.S. companies (Altiostar, Cisco, and Qualcomm) having no significant presence.In the short term, the rivalry between the U.S. and China in the region may offer Southeast Asian countries the leverage to negotiate better terms than they would get otherwise and provide more choices to balance their own interests. However, in the longer term, the bifurcation of Chinese and American technologies, standards, and norms will lead to a decline in multilateralism. This can create disadvantages for weaker countries, as they may not have the negotiating power or enforcement capabilities of a bloc. Additionally, international efforts at developing common norms, trickling down to local laws, may be derailed.Southeast Asian nations must find ways to identify and address some of the inherent weaknesses and challenges that undermine their capacity to plan for and support the adoption of AI technologies. This will enable them to reap the benefits of AI on their own terms and find their place in a future AI ecosystem dominated by the two superpowers.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2022-02-07-044540.jpg;False;;27.394989;9fdb1b3eaaa6320c4be66b49145970d5;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND DSR', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

Unlike traditional Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects that are often led by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), this Digital Silk Road (DSR) is being spearheaded by private tech companies that are primarily profit-driven.Enjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.Efforts by MENA nations to digitize and diversify their economies have made them attractive markets for these Chinese firms to expand their presence abroad. Draws for companies looking to enter the region include a relatively stable physical and digital infrastructure compared to other developing BRI regions, steadily growing internet penetration, and a digital economy projected to reach $400 billion by 2030.All this creates the impression that China-MENA technology cooperation is simply being driven by market forces. However, the logic driving China's engagement with the MENA region extends beyond the law of supply and demand and into the realm of geostrategy.Ubiquitous Connectivity AdvertisementIn a 2016 speech, China's top leader Xi Jinping said, 'We must encourage and support China's internet companies to go global … so as to achieve the principle of ‘wherever our national interests are, [our] informatization [technology] will also cover those areas.'' Through the DSR, China seeks to connect its civilian and military assets along the Belt and Road Initiative. The Pakistan & East Africa Connecting Europe fiber optic cable, or PEACE, exemplifies these efforts.PEACE travels from the BRI's flagship $62 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to Djibouti –where the Chinese military established a naval base in 2017. From there, it traverses the Bab al Mandab strait, a critical maritime choke point, and moves toward China-Egypt Teda Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone, where China has built a 7.34 sq km industrial estate. PEACE then travels through the Mediterranean and onward to Europe.Infrastructure like PEACE ensures that Chinese port operators enjoy the high-speed, low-latency connectivity critical for maintaining the integrity of supply chains and other activities that promote China's economic stability. Add to the mix that China, like other countries, relies on this vulnerable civilian infrastructure to coordinate military operations and Beijing's impetus to establish control over these networks should come as no surprise.Scholars like Zheng Anqi of the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology have directly linked military power with 'information power.' According to Zheng, 'The foundation of an information force is the network. Without the support of ubiquitous, broadband, and mobile networks, a powerful information army is just empty talk.'The 1996 Taiwan strait missile crisis illuminated precisely how a missing link in the technology stack can disrupt military operations when the PLA lost track of two missiles it fired into the East China Sea. Chinese military officers attributed the failure to a disruption in the U.S.-controlled Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) technology. Since then, China has worked hard to develop its own BeiDou Navigation Satellite System and has looked to MENA for cooperation partners.In 2017, the country launched the China-Arab States BeiDou Cooperation Forum. Shortly after the second forum concluded in Tunis in 2019, Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Defense and the Equipment Development Commission of China signed an MoU to cooperate in the military use of BeiDou. Admittedly, the data gathered from these satellites have applications that extend far beyond the military domain. For example, BeiDou has been deployed commercially in fields as diverse as environmental monitoring, smart agriculture, disaster relief, and transportation in Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Lebanon, Oman, and Morocco.Data as a Source of PowerEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.Much of the infrastructure along the Digital Silk Road is data-driven. Undersea cables, for instance, transmit more than 95 percent of global internet traffic and facilitate trillions of dollars in international financial transactions daily. Beyond the PEACE cable, Chinese companies like HMN tech (formerly Huawei Marine), China Telecom, and China Unicom have constructed, upgraded, or acquired ownership stakes in at least nine other cables traversing MENA.Meanwhile, companies like Shenzhen-based Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) have won hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts with U.S. allies like Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia. Thanks to these deals, BGI is now privy to reams of sensitive biological data.China has come to view data as a critical commodity and source of power. Key policy documents like the Action Plan to Promote the Development of Big Data (2015) and the 13th Five-Year-Plan (2016) designate data as 'a foundational strategic resource' alongside land, labor, and capital. The Action Plan calls for the country to 'comprehensively advance the development and application of big data' and 'accelerate the construction of a strong data country.' Beijing has since created legal frameworks for companies to provide data to the central government on national security grounds.AdvertisementAnalysts have since raised concerns that data collected along China's Digital Silk Road may help China manipulate political perceptions, spread authoritarianism, and undermine democracy. The opaque public-private sector nexus and the ambiguity surrounding what constitutes ‘national security grounds' have only reinforced these fears.Countering US Containment Against the backdrop of renewed great power competition, Beijing has come to view its technology cooperation with MENA as increasingly important in countering U.S. efforts to contain China's rising power and influence. Since 2018, the United States has succeeded in persuading many firms and allied nations worldwide to 'decouple' from Chinese technology and supply chains. That year, Chinese investment and infrastructure projects declined in every region – except the Middle East and North Africa.The flow of capital is also slowly becoming more bi-directional: Oil-rich Gulf countries are now investing in China's high-end manufacturing, advanced technology, and research and development. For example, when Jaka Robotics, a Chinese startup that makes collaborative robots, pulled in a Series D funding round of over $150 million in July 2022, a growth fund under Saudi Aramco Ventures was among the lead investors. Two months later, the Saudi Company for Artificial Intelligence (SCAI) announced it would inject around $206 million into a joint venture with China's SenseTime to build a state-of-the-art AI lab and advance Saudi Arabia's AI-tech ecosystem.In its quest to dominate the strategic technologies of tomorrow, China has also turned to MENA nations to acquire digital innovations and know-how. Israel's vibrant innovation ecosystem has become a prime target in this regard. Since 2002 the vast majority of Chinese investments and M&A deals in Israel have been in the tech sector – over $9 billion worth. Through these deals, Huawei acquired Israeli cybersecurity startup Hexatier for $42 million and IT company Toga Networks for over $100 million. Today, Toga employs over 350 leading experts and continues to serve as a Huawei R&D center.With 9,547 active high-tech companies, Israel is undoubtedly the most enticing source of innovative technologies in the region. But when it comes to Chinese R&D partnerships, Beijing has looked beyond Israel's 'Silicon Wadi.' Huawei has set up OpenLabs in Cairo, Dubai, and Istanbul to develop innovations in cloud computing, big data, smart cities, and other core technologies. The facility in Turkey is Huawei's largest overseas R&D operation and receives over $20 million annually in funding.Beyond Huawei, 2018 saw Alibaba Cloud and the UAE's Khalifa University of Science and Technology agree to launch a Joint Innovation Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence for Clean Energy. That same year the UAE's International Center for Biosaline Agriculture in the United Arab Emirates partnered with BGI to establish an advanced genomics center.China Wins TwiceOn the face of it, these partnerships appear a win-win. However, an April 2022 study by political economy researcher Tin Hinane El Kadi suggests that this is not always the case. In her examination of Huawei's localization efforts in Algeria and Egypt, El Kadi notes that Huawei often 'engaged in training, manufacturing, and R&D in a way designed to maintain the firm's technological edge' and 'without engaging in meaningful capacity building.'To qualify: not all Chinese technology systems are malignant. Moreover, there are immense economic and social benefits to cooperating with China in the digital realm, including enhanced industrial efficiency, job creation, better access to education, crime reduction, improved road safety, and more financial inclusion. Chinese companies offer cutting-edge technology at an affordable price, and China doesn't condition cooperation on democratizing or liberalizing local institutions.Regardless of these perceived benefits, pundits and policymakers would be naive to ignore the geostrategic dimensions of China's technology outreach. In a May 2021 speech before hundreds of the nation's elite scientists gathered in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, Xi Jinping himself declared: 'Technological innovation has become the main battlefield of the international strategic game.' MENA countries are part of this game, whether they acknowledge it or not.As MENA nations become ever more reliant on Chinese technology systems, Beijing is accruing leverage and influence. These emerging dependencies serve as a deterrence mechanism in that any governments or companies that dare offend China would risk being cut off from its massive market and the critical technologies that enable daily life. From Beijing's perspective, this framework would ideally contribute to shaping a world more accommodating to China and its interests.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2022-11-17-143105.jpg;False;;25.01968;5663237dc4db8fd741fb1e119ae8755d;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND DSR', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}
10;How China Is Attempting to Control the ‘Information Pipes';;2023-03-03 13:45:09;full;https://thediplomat.com/2023/03/how-china-is-attempting-to-control-the-information-pipes/;thediplomat.com;In addition to beaming out its perspectives via Chinese state media, Beijing is aspiring to control both the structure and norms of global information networks.;"Advertisement
In the past decade, China's government has stepped up its efforts to wield powerful tools of information around the globe – in its near neighborhood and, increasingly in more distant places including North America, Africa, Latin America, and Europe. These tools include Beijing's own major state media outlets, like Xinhua, which have been expanded while China tries to make them credible, palatable alternatives to existing global newswires based in liberal democracies, like The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, Reuters, Kyodo, and others. It also includes Beijing's growing efforts to use proxies to control Chinese-language media outlets within other countries around the world, as well as Beijing's increasingly sophisticated use of disinformation on major social media platforms in its neighborhood and globally.
Yet even as China attempts to use the control over media and information it has amassed, it is also working to dominate the 'pipes' through which this information moves. I use the term 
pipes
 to mean the broad underpinnings of global information networks, including the actual physical infrastructure and the rules and norms that govern how information flows. More specifically, these pipes include the physical telecommunications networks for wireless and wired data; mobile phones and other devices that display information; tools that create the Internet of Things; tools that allow for surveillance; leading search engines, web browsers, and social media platforms; and the standards that govern the internet.
With greater influence in these areas, China would not have to rely as much on other countries to disseminate Xinhua, CGTN, and CRI, or on media coverage from local Chinese-language outlets controlled by Beijing. Instead, it could use its own pipes to more aggressively, and mostly covertly, spread state media coverage onto internet networks, social media platforms, mobile phones and other devices, browsers, and television conglomerates controlled by or closely linked to the Chinese government, which would deprive news consumers in many countries of independent coverage about China.
If Beijing had more control of the pipes of information, it also could, within foreign countries, more easily censor negative stories and social media conversations, and spread stories, rumors, opinions, accusations, blandishments, and other types of disinformation, obviously types of sharp power. Ultimately, it could use the pipes to help foreign countries copy China's surveillance strategies and to export China's vision of a closed and controlled domestic internet, part of Beijing's overall model of technology-enabled authoritarianism.

Building the Internet

Chinese state companies are laying down many of the new physical or virtual pipes for global information flows in the developing world. The state-controlled China Telecom, for instance, has rolled out the third-biggest mobile phone network in the Philippines, despite concerns raised by security experts and some lawmakers about Beijing dominating a portion of the country's mobile infrastructure. China Telecom partnered with the tycoon Dennis Uy, a close ally of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, in obtaining and rolling out its mobile network. This is a strategy Chinese state firms have used in many countries. By partnering with local tycoons, Chinese firms often are able to land contracts to build mobile and fixed internet infrastructure, sometimes without any transparent bidding processes.
In Africa, Beijing has become by far the dominant builder of new physical infrastructure for the transmission of information. China Telecom and ZTE, whose biggest shareholder is a state-owned enterprise, are building the core of new mobile and fiber-optic networks across the African continent, competing largely with Huawei, which is a private Chinese company, but with historic links to the People's Liberation Army.
In return, they get help. Under China's Digital Silk Road (DSR) initiative, part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), many Chinese companies that build telecommunications infrastructure in Africa and other regions get loans from Chinese banks on extremely generous terms. Non-Chinese competitors face huge hurdles in corralling the same level of diplomatic support from their own governments or getting anything like the cheap financing, usually from Chinese state banks, that Chinese companies enjoy.

Huawei has signed numerous commercial contracts around the world to build next-generation 5G networks, though it has been shut out of many liberal democracies. Still, it is poised to be the dominant 5G provider in sub-Saharan Africa, with competitors lagging behind. In Southeast Asia, meanwhile, Huawei already has built many of the shorter undersea cables linking the region's telecommunications networks, and the company has inked deals to develop 5G networks in Cambodia, the Philippines, and Thailand – and possibly in Indonesia. And in the Pacific Islands, Huawei and other Chinese tech giants have competed aggressively with Australian and other companies to make new deals in places like Fiji. Around the world, Huawei is completing thousands of miles of undersea cable, through which most telecommunications traffic travels. In Central Asia, meanwhile, Huawei has already become the dominant provider of new 5G technology, including in the region's most populous state, Uzbekistan, and its freest, Kyrgyzstan.
Even in some democracies where leaders have significant concerns about allowing Chinese companies to build telecommunications infrastructure, Huawei has made inroads, although some of its efforts are now stalling in richer countries worried about the downsides of being reliant on Huawei and other Chinese tech firms. Yet Huawei's low costs and high levels of experience with technology often give them a leg up in getting contracts to build infrastructure, particularly in developing countries. Huawei also has become increasingly innovative, becoming one of the biggest investors in research and development of any tech company in the world.
Chinese firms are winning Internet of Things (IoT) contracts as well. Beijing has placed a particular priority on this sector since at least the late 2000s, when then-Premier Wen Jiabao declared it a national priority. Emily de La Bruyère and Nathan Picarsic, formerly of the consulting firm Long Term Strategy Group, have written that Chinese companies have built 'a network of sensors [in China] – including but not limited to surveillance cameras, car navigation systems, and smart electricity monitors.' Any information that is gathered is passed along to the China Academy of Sciences (CAS), a leading Chinese research institution. According to de La Bruyère and Picarsic, CAS 'explains that the system is a ‘test zone for a global network.''
Poland and other European states have given IoT contracts to Chinese companies, like the surveillance camera giant Hikvision, which is part of a massive state enterprise.  Chinese-built surveillance camera systems even have been used in official buildings in Europe and North America, including departments of the U.K. government and U.S. military bases, though they now have been banned. In 2019, the U.S. government added Hikvision and several other Chinese firms to an economic blacklist, in part due to their involvement in abuses in Xinjiang. (The Hikvision cameras were being used on U.S. bases right up until the ban.) But even these U.S. actions did not appear to stop the firms' global expansion.
Apps and Screens
Social media platforms are another kind of information pipe. A decade ago, Chinese companies had virtually no presence on social media. Since then, Chinese firms like WeChat, Weibo, and TikTok have expanded quickly, both at home and abroad.
TikTok, the short-video app, now rivals longer-established social media networks like Twitter and Instagram in terms of its number of new users, and is gaining massive cultural influence among preteens, teens, and young adults around the world. In 2021, it had the most downloads of any app, even though it was only launched globally in 2017.  The app has become omnipresent on the phones of high school and college students, with an estimated 40 percent of its users between the ages of 16 and 24.

TikTok's parent company, ByteDance Limited, presents itself as a global firm, and TikTok as no different from platforms run by U.S.-based companies like Facebook or Twitter. But these claims ring hollow, as multiple reports have found that TikTok has at times tried to alter or suppress content related to China, and as the Chinese government has taken a stake in ByteDance and gained an important seat on its board.
The China-based app WeChat also has begun to spread outside China. WeChat, owned by the Chinese conglomerate Tencent, has become a ubiquitous tool in China: Many middle-class Chinese have come to rely on it for much of their family, social, and work lives.
Usage of WeChat is spreading among Chinese speakers in every corner of the world. It has 1.24 billion users and it has expanded across Southeast Asia and South Asia. The United States, meanwhile, is believed to be the second largest-source of WeChat users, behind China. The Trump administration tried to crack down on it and its parent company with an executive order – but WeChat is still accessible, since the Biden administration rescinded plans to ban its service in the United States.

In Thailand, nearly 20 percent of the population uses the app.  In Malaysia, a country of around 32 million people, there are reportedly 20 million WeChat accounts. The app's group chats, which can include up to 500 people, are channels for the spread of information sympathetic to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), while people who offer critical commentary in the chat are censored. (While WeChat is not known primarily as a news app, its content often contains news stories, links to stories, and discussions about stories, making it a major disseminator of information about Chinese domestic and foreign policies.) In Northeast Asia, WeChat has become the second-most-popular messaging app in Mongolia, and is widely used in Japan and South Korea.
While Chinese social media platforms are spreading, Chinese mobile phone makers also are enjoying success, particularly in developing regions like Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. In these places, inexpensive Chinese phones have gained huge market shares, competing with more expensive rivals like Samsung and Apple. And because China was an early adapter in many new smartphone-related features like having one super app like WeChat, Chinese firms actually have surpassed non-Chinese rivals in developing many apps beloved by consumers, as well as developing specific innovations for markets in Africa and other developing regions.
The numbers do not lie. Today, China-based mobile phone companies make more than half of the phones purchased annually in Africa, including both smartphones and budget phones. In Southeast Asia, they are becoming increasingly popular, after garnering two-thirds of the market in India, a major geopolitical rival, and much of the market in China.
Many Chinese-made phones come loaded with the apps of the biggest Chinese social media platforms and web browsers, giving them an instant entrée to users in Africa, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and other regions, although they have also been accused of coming preloaded with spyware.
Chinese companies also are gaining ground in the global digital television market. They are no longer just copying foreign technologies but have become innovative and competitive. The Chinese pay television company StarTimes, for example, has become one of Africa's leading digital television operators. With its cheap TV packages and easy-to-install hardware, it can reach formerly unserved populations from Kenya to Nigeria to Rwanda.
'The pay TV company [i.e., StarTimes] is leading the continent's transition from analog to digital television with some of the world's most affordable cable/satellite TV packages priced as low as $4 per month. In the burgeoning Digital TV sector, StarTimes is far and away the market leader. The company's reach covers 90 percent of the continent's population,' wrote Eric Olander. StarTimes has announced nascent plans to expand its inexpensive services into Latin America as well.
Other large Chinese companies are entering the digital and satellite television markets in Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. ZTE has launched digital television services in Pakistan and is exploring other markets, while Chinese provincial and national state television networks are expanding into neighboring Southeast Asian cable markets like Laos, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam.
Influence Through Omission
By controlling the information pipes, Beijing can exert influence through omission. In other words, what does not appear about China in the media in other states can be as important as what does appear.
Beijing wants to silence conversations about many topics – Xinjiang, Tibet, the South China Sea, its  policies, and so on. It wants to make these tough topics disappear. And if they disappear for an extended period of time from media coverage and public conversations in other countries, that disappearance feeds on itself, creating a greater boon for China. Publics and opinion leaders do not learn about these issues sensitive to China; over time, publics and opinion leaders become less informed about these issues; with less information, they naturally speak and write about the topics less and less.
It is next to impossible for China to get positive coverage about these topics if they are covered openly and fairly. China could achieve this outcome, of course, through clear and open threats to punish other countries with economic measures, diplomatic measures, or other sanctions, for instance. But the bullying approach, though it certainly has worked with foreign companies and some foreign states fearful of being excluded from China's market or facing other sanctions from Beijing, has major downsides as well.
WeChat provides an opportunity for Beijing to help contain what appears in the news about China in other countries. As users outside China have gravitated to the app, including its popular messaging service, WeChat has become a central source of news for many Chinese-language speakers beyond the mainland. Wanning Sun, of the University of Technology Sydney, has found that while most Mandarin speakers in Australia do not get much of their news directly from Chinese state media, a majority of them do access WeChat and obtain news from it, such as from news shared in groups and messages. In fact, Sun found that about 60 percent of Mandarin speakers in Australia used WeChat as their primary source of news and information.

After an interval of five years, it will be my fourth visit to the beautiful country known for its vast steppe, majestic landscape and hospitable people. I very much look forward to the visit.Bound together by mountains and rivers and common interests, China and Kazakhstan are good neighbors, good friends and good partners. For thousands of years, the two peoples have had amicable ties, jointly writing an epic of east-west interactions along the ancient Silk Road. Huen Tsang, an eminent Tang Dynasty monk (602-664), and Chen Cheng, a Ming Dynasty envoy (1365-1457), both set foot on Kazakhstan. Al-Farabi the ""Eastern Aristotle"", Abai Kunanbayev the ""sage poet"", and other towering cultural figures of Kazakhstan enjoy widespread fame in China. To this day, their stories are still being told among the two peoples.This year marks the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Kazakhstan. Over the past three decades, we have braved wind and rain, with our hands always held firmly together. Our interactions and cooperation have become ever more vibrant, and we have travelled an extraordinary path side by side.-- Over the past 30 years, China-Kazakhstan relations have made big strides. We have continuously advanced our relationship from good neighbors to strategic partners and to permanent comprehensive strategic partners. This incomparable characterization of our ties has enabled us to develop a new type of state-to-state relations featuring mutual respect, good-neighborly friendship, solidarity in trying times, and win-win cooperation. We always give each other unwavering support on the core issues bearing on our respective sovereignty, security and territorial integrity. We always respect each other's choice of development path based on national conditions. And we always take pleasure in each other's sustained progress in development and national rejuvenation. We are friends to trust and partners to count on for each other, and our peoples always stand shoulder to shoulder with each other.-- Over the past 30 years, China-Kazakhstan cooperation has yielded remarkable results. In recent years, China has been solidly one of Kazakhstan's leading partners for trade and investment. Navigating the impact of COVID-19, we were able to again bring our bilateral trade above the US$25 billion mark last year, jointly giving a boost to global economic recovery. China and Kazakhstan are pioneers in production capacity and investment cooperation; our cooperation list includes 52 projects worth a total of more than US$21.2 billion. We have completed a number of major strategic projects, such as the 100-MW Zhanatas wind farm, the JAC automobile factory, and Shymkent Oil Refinery modernization. They have been a strong driving force for economic and social progress in Kazakhstan, and have delivered tangible benefits to our two peoples.-- Over the past 30 years, China and Kazakhstan have built extensive infrastructure links. We have put in place a multidimensional transportation network composed of road, railway, aviation, and oil and gas pipelines. And we are resolved to build a Eurasian land-sea multimodal ""transportation artery"" to offer convenient and efficient services. At all of our five road crossings and two rail crossings, normal cargo flows have resumed. And we are in close communication about opening another rail crossing. At the China-Kazakhstan International Logistics Base in the eastern Chinese port of Lianyungang, products from Kazakhstan set sail for the Pacific Ocean. The China-Europe freight trains are running through Kazakhstan via more routes, making an important contribution to the stability of global industrial and supply chains.-- Over the past 30 years, China-Kazakhstan friendship has taken deep roots among our peoples. In Kazakhstan, there are five Confucius Institutes; in China, four universities have opened institutes on Kazakhstan studies and two have added the Kazakh language as a major. The heart-warming story of Xian Xinghai and Bakhtzhan Baikadamov, two great composers in our respective countries, has been turned into a movie. Dr. Saulebek Kabilbekov of Kazakhstan has been working for 24 years in the Daqing Ophthalmology Hospital of Heilongjiang Province, treating nearly 200,000 Chinese patients. China and Kazakhstan will soon establish cultural centers in each other's countries, and Kazakhstan will host a center of traditional medicine and a Luban Workshop. Our cultural and people-to-people exchanges will make greater strides, and the friendship between our peoples will continue to thrive on an increasingly solid foundation.Having stood the test of the changing circumstances and the passage of time, China-Kazakhstan relations have long become rock-solid. We should cherish this hard-won achievement, and work harder to carry on the cause of friendship between our two countries. During my upcoming visit, I will have in-depth discussions with President Tokayev on how to further the China-Kazakhstan permanent comprehensive strategic partnership and how to advance our mutually beneficial cooperation across the board. We will set out plans for working together to promote China-Kazakhstan relations with the objective and vision of building a China-Kazakhstan community with a shared future.First, we need to carry forward our good-neighborly friendship. Deep political mutual trust is the bedrock of the steady and sustained development of China-Kazakhstan relations. China is willing to work with Kazakhstan to make top-level designs for the relationship from a strategic and long-term perspective, maintain close high-level interactions, and enhance exchanges and cooperation between our governments, legislatures, political parties and localities at various levels. We should make good use of the regular Prime Ministers' Meetings and the China-Kazakhstan Cooperation Committee and its sub-committees, continue to give each other firm support on issues concerning our respective core interests and major concerns, and make continuous efforts to cement the political foundation of China-Kazakhstan relations.Second, we need to further deepen mutually beneficial cooperation. Next year will be the tenth anniversary of the Silk Road Economic Belt initiative that I first proposed during my visit to Kazakhstan in 2013. From laying the groundwork to building pillars and frameworks, to delivering results on the ground, and to achieving sustainable progress, the Belt and Road Initiative has become a platform for international cooperation that is open, inclusive, mutually beneficial and promotes win-win cooperation and a global public good widely welcomed by the international community. Setting our sight beyond the pandemic, China would like to partner with Kazakhstan to remain pioneers in Belt and Road cooperation. We should improve investment and trade facilitation, fully unleash the potential of border ports and cross-border transportation, and cultivate new sources of growth such as artificial intelligence, big data, digital finance, e-commerce and green energy. We should commit ourselves to a series of new quality projects that are high-standard, sustainable, and beneficial to the people, bring bilateral cooperation to a higher level, and put the Global Development Initiative into action, so as to contribute our shares to world economic recovery.Third, we need to firmly safeguard common security. In the face of complex regional and international landscapes, only by embracing unity and cooperation can we overcome difficulties of our times and resolve challenges in security governance. China would like to deepen law enforcement, security and defense cooperation with Kazakhstan. Guided by the Global Security Initiative, we should act on the concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and work together to promote the implementation of the Data Security Cooperation Initiative of China+Central Asia. We should join hands to combat terrorism, separatism, extremism, drug trafficking and transnational organized crimes, and ensure the security of oil and gas pipelines and other large cooperation projects and their personnel. We should resolutely oppose interference by external forces and work together for lasting peace and long-term stability of our region.Fourth, we need to strengthen international coordination in all respects. We need to enhance coordination within multilateral frameworks such as the UN, the SCO, CICA, and China+Central Asia. We should exchange views timely on international governance, food security, energy security, industrial and supply chains stability, and regional hotspots. We should reject unilateralism and bloc confrontation, and jointly push for an international order that is more just and more equitable.The Communist Party of China (CPC) will convene its 20th National Congress soon. It will be a gathering of great significance at an important moment as the CPC embarks on a new journey of building a modern socialist country in all respects and marching toward the second centenary goal. We are glad to see that the construction of a New Kazakhstan has been fully launched, and that Kazakhstan is making strides toward the goal of becoming one of the world's top 30 most developed states. China stands ready to continue to share development achievements with Kazakhstan and learn from each other's development experience. China's door of opening-up and friendly cooperation will always be open to Kazakhstan.As a Kazakh proverb goes, ""Friendship is an inexhaustible wealth."" China believes that as long as we keep to the principle of good-neighborly friendship and deepen all-round win-win cooperation, we will surely usher in a more splendid thirty years in China-Kazakhstan relations.";cctv.com;792;economics;MY;en;zhangrui;https://p3.img.cctvpic.com/photoworkspace/2022/09/14/2022091407333343429.jpg;False;;18.238977;6e4b754cee59b370fc911374b493f755;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

The two heads of state jointly stood on the podium as the military band played the national anthems of China and Kazakhstan. Accompanied by Tokayev, Xi inspected the honor guard.After the welcome ceremony, Tokayev invited Xi to an art exhibition titled ""Kazakhstan-China: A Dialogue Across Millennium. On display were Chinese and Kazakh art treasures from the State Museum of Arts of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The exquisite Chinese paintings and porcelains and the Kazakh silks and ceramics are vivid testaments to the mutual learning between the splendid Chinese and Kazakh civilizations over the millennium. They also bear historical witness to the friendly exchanges between generations of Chinese and Kazakh people.The two Presidents held formal talks.Xi pointed out that over the past three decades since China and Kazakhstan established diplomatic ties, the bilateral relationship has stood the test of the changing international landscape, achieving greater substance, higher levels and more fruitful outcomes.The two countries have created many ""firsts"" in their relations, including the first in settling the boundary question, the first in laying cross-border oil and gas pipelines, the first in conducting international production capacity cooperation and the first in building a permanent comprehensive strategic partnership, Xi said.China highly values its relations with Kazakhstan, and firmly supports Kazakhstan in safeguarding national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and in taking reform measures to preserve national stability and development, Xi said, adding that China will always be a trustworthy and reliable friend and partner of Kazakhstan.China is ready to work with Kazakhstan in firmly supporting each other's development and rejuvenation, and helping each other achieve development and prosperity.

The two sides should also step up international coordination, practice true multilateralism and contribute their shares to building a more just and equitable global governance system, he added.Tokayev expressed warm congratulations to China on its great development achievements under the leadership of Xi, and wished the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China a full success.Tokayev said the fact that Xi chooses to visit Kazakhstan on his first overseas trip since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of China-Kazakhstan diplomatic relations, fully reflects the high degree of mutual trust between the two countries and the high-level nature of the Kazakhstan-China permanent comprehensive strategic partnership.The two sides will sign a joint statement to demonstrate their firm commitment to another golden 30 years of Kazakhstan-China relations, which is of special and great significance in the current volatile and complex international environment, Tokayev noted, adding that it is believed that Xi's visit will mark a new milestone in the history of Kazakhstan-China relations and bring new substance and impetus to the growth of the permanent comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries.Kazakhstan will continue to firmly uphold the one-China policy and be a good partner and good friend that China can always rely on under all circumstances, Tokayev said.Noting that next year will mark the tenth anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) proposed by Xi, Tokayev said that the BRI has become an important engine driving the building of a community with a shared future for mankind, and Kazakhstan will continue to actively support and participate in the BRI.Tokayev expressed appreciation to China for the valuable support Kazakhstan had received in its battle against COVID-19 and pursuit of economic development, adding that Kazakhstan hopes to better synergize development strategies with China, intensify exchanges at various levels, and deepen cooperation across the board including in economy and trade, infrastructure, energy, manufacturing, science and technology, tourism and people-to-people engagements.Kazakhstan stands ready to work with China to implement the Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative, enhance coordination and collaboration within frameworks such as the SCO, CICA and China+Central Asia, and jointly safeguard security and stability in the region and promote common development, Tokayev said.The two heads of state signed and issued the Joint Statement Between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Kazakhstan on the 30th Anniversary of the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations, and announced that China and Kazakhstan will work for the goal and vision of building a community with a shared future defined by lasting friendship, a high degree of mutual trust and sharing weal and woe.Relevant departments of the two sides signed bilateral cooperation documents in such areas as economy and trade, connectivity, finance, water conservancy and the media.

I am here to join my Arab friends for the first China-Arab States Summit and the first China-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Summit and to pay a state visit to Saudi Arabia. Designed as a trip of building on the past and more importantly, of opening up a better future, the visit will carry forward our traditional friendship, and usher in a new era in China's relations with the Arab world, with Arab states of the Gulf, and with Saudi Arabia.First, a time-honored friendship that goes back thousands of yearsThe exchanges between China and Arab states date back more than 2,000 years. The constant streams of caravans along the land Silk Road and the billowing sails along the maritime Spice Road have borne witness to how the Chinese and Arab civilizations interacted with and inspired each other across the Asian continent. It was through these exchanges that Chinese porcelain and paper-making and printing techniques were introduced to the West while Arab astronomy, calendar and medicine went all the way to the East. We have traded goods, sparked innovation, shared ideas, and spread the fruits of cultural exchanges to the rest of the world, leaving a splendid chapter in East-West engagement and mutual learning.The contacts between China and Arab states of the Gulf are well documented. During the Eastern Han Dynasty, Gan Ying, a Chinese emissary, reached the ""western seas,"" namely the Gulf, on his mission to the Roman Empire. This is the first official record of Chinese envoys reaching Arab states of the Gulf. More than 1,200 years ago, an Arab navigator, Abu Obeida, sailed from Sohar Port to the Chinese city of Guangzhou on a legendary journey that was later adapted to the exciting and well-known adventures of Sindbad. In the 1980s, a replica ship named the Sohar retraced the route opened by ancient Arab navigators, connecting the past and present friendly interactions between the two sides.China and Saudi Arabia have admired each other and conducted friendly exchanges since ancient times. The prophet Muhammad said, ""Seek knowledge even if you have to go as far as China."" Seven hundred years ago, Wang Dayuan, a Chinese traveler of the Yuan Dynasty, arrived at Mecca which he described as a place with beautiful sceneries, mild weather, fertile rice fields, and a happy people in his book A Brief Account of Islands. It was an important book from which the Chinese learned about Saudi Arabia at that time. Six hundred years ago, Zheng He, a Chinese navigator of the Ming Dynasty, reached Jeddah and Medina on his oceangoing voyages, leaving behind him many stories of friendship and exchanges that are still widely told today. The joint Chinese-Saudi archaeological excavation of the ruins of the al Serrian port conducted in recent years has unearthed many porcelain wares of China's Song and Yuan dynasties. They stand as testaments to all those friendly interactions.Second, solidarity and cooperation for a China-Arab community with a shared future in the new eraThe Arab world is an important member of the developing world and a key force for upholding international fairness and justice. The Arab people value independence, oppose external interference, stand up to power politics and high-handedness, and always seek to make progress. Arab states are endowed with diverse resources, and have built industries with distinctive features, scored remarkable achievements in development, and demonstrated enormous potentials. The Arab civilization advocates the middle way and moderation, encourages inclusiveness and mutual learning, opposes clash of civilizations, and is deeply rooted in its rich culture and history. Be it on the world political, economic or cultural map, Arab states always claim an important place.Since the 1950s, China has established diplomatic relations with all Arab states. Their interactions feature mutual understanding, mutual respect, mutual assistance and solidarity. They have become good friends treating each other as equals, good partners pursuing mutual benefit, and good brothers sharing weal and woe. In the 21st century, China-Arab relations have continued to move ahead against a fluid international landscape, and achieved historic leapfrog growth in political trust, mutually beneficial economic cooperation, and cultural mutual learning in both breadth and depth.In the past decade, China-Arab relations entered a new era and registered a series of landmark and groundbreaking achievements in various areas. Collectively, China has established a future-oriented strategic partnership of comprehensive cooperation and common development with all Arab states. Individually, China has established comprehensive strategic partnership or strategic partnership with 12 Arab states, and signed documents on Belt and Road cooperation with 20 Arab states. Among Arab countries, 17 have expressed support for the Global Development Initiative (GDI), 15 have become members of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and 14 have participated in the China-League of Arab States Cooperation Initiative on Data Security.Arab states firmly support the one-China principle and support China in safeguarding its core interests. Likewise, China supports Arab states in upholding sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. On issues such as the Palestinian question, China's firm support for Arab states has been consistent and unwavering. Major infrastructure projects jointly built by the two sides, including the Djamaa El Djazair mosque of Algeria, the Lusail Stadium of Qatar, the new headquarters of the Central Bank of Kuwait, as well as the Merowe Dam, the Roseires Dam heightening, and the Upper Atbara Dams Complex Project of Sudan, have become landmarks of China-Arab friendship. China has set up 20 Confucius institutes and two Confucius classrooms in Arab states. And over 40 Chinese universities teach Arabic as a major, contributing inexhaustible energy for growing China-Arab friendship.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, China and Arab states have come to each other's aid and navigated through the difficulties together. The two sides have carried out efficient cooperation in such areas as vaccine research and application, joint epidemic prevention and control, experience sharing, medical services and pharmaceuticals, setting a fine example of solidarity in fighting the virus. Under the framework of China-Arab States Cooperation Forum, 17 cooperation mechanisms have been launched to expand and substantiate the cooperation agenda, giving a strong boost to China-Arab relations and providing a paradigm for the solidarity and cooperation among developing countries.The world is now undergoing momentous changes unseen in a century. Both China and Arab states face the historic mission of realizing national rejuvenation and speeding up national development. In this new context, China will work with Arab states to carry forward the traditional friendship and jointly build a China-Arab community with a shared future in the new era. China and Arab states will continue to hold high the banner of non-interference in internal affairs, firmly support each other in safeguarding sovereignty and territorial integrity, and jointly uphold international fairness and justice. We will continue to enhance together Belt and Road cooperation, keep expanding practical cooperation in such areas as food, energy, investment, financing and medical services, and pursue mutually beneficial cooperation with higher quality and in greater depth. We will continue to jointly act on the GDI and the Global Security Initiative so as to stabilize volatile regions and contribute more positive energy to peace and development. We will continue to jointly advocate peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom -- the common values of humanity, strive to replace estrangement and clash of civilizations with exchanges and mutual learning, promote understanding and affinity between our peoples, and build ""a garden of civilizations"" featuring mutual appreciation and inspiration.Third, joint endeavor to cultivate the China-GCC strategic partnershipThe GCC has achieved remarkable progress in its integration process, which makes it one of the world's most dynamic regional organizations. Given their geographical locations, GCC countries serve as a hub linking Asia, Africa and Europe. Endowed with rich energy resources, including 30 percent of the oil reserve and 20 percent of the natural gas reserve of the world, GCC countries are an energy tank for world economy. With their pioneering and enterprising spirit, GCC countries provide a fertile ground for high-tech industries. Over the past four decades and more, the GCC has been working hard to build an integral market, an integral economy, and an integral financial system in the region, and has been playing an increasingly important role in regional and international affairs.Over the years, China and GCC countries have maintained healthy and steady growth in bilateral relations, and carried out wide-ranging, in-depth cooperation with tangible outcomes in all areas. In the past 10 years in particular, China-GCC relations have grown from strength to strength and yielded fruitful results. China has remained the GCC's largest trading partner and largest export market of petrochemical products. In 2021, two-way trade exceeded 230 billion U.S. dollars, and China's import of crude oil from GCC countries topped 200 million tons. The two sides enjoy extensive, in-depth cooperation in traditional areas such as production capacity, infrastructure development, investment and finance. Cooperation in high-tech sectors including 5G communications, new energy, space and digital economy is also gaining momentum. The new signature project of smart manufacturing cooperation and the new landscape of industrial cooperation have added fresh impetus to the development of China and GCC countries.Looking into the future, China will seize the opportunity of the establishment and consolidation of the China-GCC strategic partnership to cement their traditional friendship and deepen mutual trust. China will continue to firmly support GCC countries in upholding sovereignty, independence, security and stability, and continue to support the GCC in accelerating integration and pursuing diversified development. China will work with the GCC to foster a new pattern of multi-faceted energy cooperation, accelerate new development in financial and investment cooperation, cultivate new highlights in people-to-people exchanges, and explore new areas of innovation cooperation. All this will help increase the convergence of interests between China and GCC countries.Fourth, sustained efforts to bring the China-Saudi Arabia comprehensive strategic partnership to new heightsSaudi Arabia is a major energy exporter in the world and a member of the G20. As its strategic partner and true friend, China is heartened to see that under the leadership of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi people are marching in big strides toward Vision 2030 and making important progress in economic and social reform and diversification. Saudi Arabia's major development initiatives, the Middle East Green Initiative and the Saudi Green Initiative among many others, have captured wide attention. Its stature and influence in global political, economic and energy domains are on the rise. We are proud of our good friend for these accomplishments.Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, relations between China and Saudi Arabia have maintained robust growth. Most notably, China-Saudi Arabia cooperation has made major headway in the past 10 years. The two sides respect each other's sovereignty and development path, respect each other's history and cultural traditions, support each other in defending national security and stability, and undertake close strategic coordination. Practical cooperation is expanding rapidly. Major projects have been launched one after another, including the Yanbu Aramco Sinopec Refining Company, the Sino-Saudi Gulei Ethylene Complex Project, the Chinese industrial cluster in Jazan Economic City, the Red Sea utilities and infrastructure project, 5G communications, and joint lunar explorations. People-to-people exchanges continue to grow. Chinese language major is now available in four Saudi universities, and optional Chinese language courses are provided in eight middle and primary schools. Hakim & Kong Xiaoxi, the first animated co-production of China and Saudi Arabia, is popular among children, sowing the seed of China-Saudi Arabia friendship in their hearts.China will take this visit as an opportunity to strengthen its comprehensive strategic partnership with Saudi Arabia. We will continue to give each other understanding and support, and jointly advocate independence and oppose external interference. We will further synergize China's Belt and Road Initiative and Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, deepen and substantiate practical cooperation in all areas, and increase the convergence of interests and people-to-people connectivity between the two countries. We will strengthen collaboration under multilateral frameworks such as the UN, the G20 and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, jointly practice true multilateralism, and make greater contribution to maintaining peace and stability in the Middle East and promoting development and prosperity of the world.Last October, the Communist Party of China successfully convened its 20th National Congress, and it is now rallying and leading the Chinese people toward the goal of building a modern socialist country in all respects. As a staunch force for world peace and common development, China will stay committed to providing new opportunities for Arab states and all other countries in the world through its own development, and work with our Arab brothers to carry forward the traditional friendship and create a better future together.";cctv.com;792;science;MY;en;LiuYing;https://p1.img.cctvpic.com/photoworkspace/2022/12/08/2022120810575446529.jpg;False;;13.90437;f643db85d5f620009c63d0f088ddd0f3;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

Below is the full text.;"BEIJING, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday addressed the 21st meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in Beijing via video link.Below is the full text:Your Excellency President Emomali Rahmon,Dear Colleagues,I wish to thank you, President Rahmon, and Tajikistan for hosting this meeting under Tajikistan's Presidency of the SCO. As the SCO marks its 20th anniversary, together with all of you, I look forward to reviewing the proud history of the SCO and charting the course for even broader prospects of its future development.The past 20 years have seen evolving international developments and profound reshaping of the global governance system. These years have also seen the vigorous growth of the SCO and the fruitful, mutually beneficial cooperation among its member states. Over the past two decades, guided by the Shanghai Spirit of mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diversity of civilizations and pursuit of common development, the SCO has endeavored to promote world peace, development and human progress, and to explore new ground, both theoretically and with actual steps, with a view to building a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind.― We have jointly promoted political mutual trust. We have signed the Treaty on Long-Term Good-Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation and created a new model based on partnership and dialogue, rather than alliance or confrontation. We have supported each other on issues which involve our respective core interests and are of major concern to us. And we have provided reliable and strong backing to each other in our pursuit of development.― We have jointly ensured security and stability. We were the first to call for fighting terrorism, separatism and extremism. We have taken tough actions to curb the spread of drug trafficking, cybercrime and transnational organized crime, and jointly held counter-terrorism exercises and border control operations. We call for seeking political settlement of international and regional hotspot issues, and we have erected a strong defense to uphold peace and tranquility in our region.― We have jointly pursued prosperity and development. We have intensified practical cooperation in our region. People-to-people programs such as art festivals, the SCO University and the SCO Forum on Traditional Medicine have been launched. With the ""SCO speed"" and ""SCO efficiency"", as evidenced by the 12 percent annual growth of the total GDP of SCO member states and their trade as well as manifold increase in the number of mutual visits, we have moved faster in delivering decent lives for people in SCO countries.― We have jointly upheld international justice. We advocate multilateralism and the common values of humanity and have spoken out against hegemony and power politics. We have maintained close coordination with SCO observer states and dialogue partners as well as international and regional organizations which share the SCO's purposes and principles, and we have rallied other members of the international community to work for a shared future.Colleagues,The SCO has reached a new historical starting point. We should stay true to the Shanghai Spirit, keep to the right direction, follow the historical trends of promoting democracy in international relations, and pursue our own development as we pursue common development for humanity. Together, we can build a closer SCO community with a shared future and contribute even more to lasting global peace and common prosperity. To this end, I call for taking the following steps:First, we need to follow the journey of enhancing solidarity and cooperation. We should make the most of the meeting mechanisms and platforms at all levels, step up policy dialogue, communication and coordination, respect each other's legitimate concerns and promptly resolve problems that may arise and affect our cooperation, thus keeping the SCO on a steady course of development. We should maintain firm confidence in our systems, reject condescending lecturing, and firmly support countries in exploring development paths and governance models that are compatible with their national conditions. We should support each other in steadily advancing important political agenda including domestic elections. We must never allow any external interference in the domestic affairs of countries in our region under whatever pretext. In short, we should keep the future of our countries' development and progress firmly in our own hands.Fighting COVID-19 remains the most pressing task facing us all. We should follow the principle of putting people and their lives first and promote the spirit of science. We need to deepen international cooperation against the virus, promote fair and equitable distribution of vaccines and firmly oppose any act of politicizing COVID-19 origins tracing. To protect the lives and health of people from around the world, China has provided close to 1.2 billion doses of finished and bulk vaccines to over 100 countries and international organizations, thus becoming the biggest vaccine provider in the world. China will step up efforts to provide a total of two billion doses to other countries in the course of this year. We will deepen anti-COVID cooperation with other developing countries, make good use of China's $100 million donation to COVAX, and make our due contribution to humanity's ultimate victory over the virus.Second, we need to follow the journey of upholding our common security. Faced with complex and fluid security dynamics in the region, we need to pursue common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and take tough actions against terrorism, separatism and extremism, including the East Turkestan Islamic Movement. We need to strengthen cooperation on counter-narcotics, border control and security for major events, and speedily improve the SCO's security cooperation mechanism. We need to further implement the Convention on Countering Extremism and other legal instruments, and enhance the capacity of competent authorities of SCO countries to maintain stability and respond to emergencies.Afghanistan has undergone drastic changes. The withdrawal of foreign troops has opened a new page in its history. But Afghanistan still faces many daunting challenges, and it needs the support and assistance of the international community, particularly countries in our region. We SCO member states need to step up coordination, make full use of platforms such as the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group and facilitate a smooth transition in Afghanistan. We need to encourage Afghanistan to put in place a broad-based and inclusive political framework, adopt prudent and moderate domestic and foreign policies, resolutely fight all forms of terrorism, live in amity with its neighbors and truly embark on a path of peace, stability and development.Third, we need to follow the journey of promoting openness and integration. We SCO countries are all at a critical stage of development. Being close to each other and sharing common interests are our unique strengths. We need to give full play to such strengths, stay committed to openness and cooperation, and jointly pursue our shared goal of development and rejuvenation. We need to continue to promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation as well as the secure and orderly flow of people, goods, capital and data. We should create growth drivers of cooperation such as digital economy, green energy and modern agriculture. Belt and Road cooperation offers a major platform of promoting common development for us all. We need to strengthen complementarity between the Belt and Road Initiative and the development strategies of SCO countries and regional cooperation initiatives such as the Eurasian Economic Union. We should keep industrial and supply chains functioning smoothly, promote economic integration and interconnected development of all countries and deliver shared benefits to all.To facilitate post-COVID economic recovery in SCO countries, China will continue to share its market opportunities, strive to reach $2.3 trillion in its cumulative trade with other SCO countries in the next five years, and improve its trade structure and balance. China will open a China-SCO Business and Trade Institute to promote business and trade cooperation among SCO countries. As phase one of the RMB30 billion yuan equivalent special lending facility set up by China in 2018 within the SCO framework will soon be completed, China will launch the second phase of this special lending facility to promote Belt and Road cooperation. Such lending will mainly cover projects related to modernization, connectivity, infrastructure, and green, low-carbon and sustainable development.Fourth, we need to follow the journey of boosting interactions and mutual learning. Interactions between civilizations provide the most solid foundation for the SCO's development, and people-to-people exchanges provide the strongest driving force for our Organization. We need to encourage exchanges, dialogue, harmony and co-existence between civilizations. We should launch more projects that will appeal to our people and benefit them directly in areas including science and technology, education, culture, health and poverty alleviation, fully tap into platforms including the youth exchange camp, the women's forum, the media forum and the forum on people-to-people friendship, and social organizations such as the Good-Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation Commission. With these efforts, we can build a bridge of mutual understanding and friendship between the people of SCO countries.In the next three years, China will provide 1,000 training opportunities in poverty alleviation for other SCO countries, open 10 Luban Workshops, and launch 30 cooperation projects in such areas as health, poverty relief, culture and education under the framework of the Silk Road Community Building Initiative. This will help countries in need build capacity and improve the lives of their people. China will host an SCO youth technology and innovation forum next year to unleash the creativity of young people in SCO countries. China proposes to establish an SCO alliance of traditional medicine industries to explore new ways of boosting cooperation on traditional medicine. China welcomes your countries' participation in the 2022 Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, so that together we can deliver a streamlined, safe and splendid Olympic Games.Fifth, we need to follow the journey of upholding equity and justice. As a Chinese saying goes, ""Power may win for the time being, but justice will prevail for the long run."" Acting from a so-called ""position of strength"" is not the way to handle international affairs, and hegemonic, domineering and bullying acts should be firmly rejected. In addressing international relations, we should observe the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. We need to practice true multilateralism and oppose actions that use the name of so-called rules to undermine the international order and cause confrontation and division. We need to boost mutually beneficial cooperation, remove trade, investment and technology barriers, and promote inclusive development that delivers benefits to all.Colleagues,Today, we will launch procedures to admit Iran as a member state of the SCO and Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Qatar as new dialogue partners. I am confident that the growing SCO family will stride ahead together with all the progressive forces of the world, and be the builders of world peace, contributors to global development and defenders of the international order.China will support Uzbekistan in its upcoming SCO presidency. I am sure that with the joint efforts of all our member states, the SCO will continue to scale new heights in all areas of cooperation.Colleagues,Let us hold high the banner of the Shanghai Spirit, stay true to the SCO's founding mission, advance in the right direction of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and embark on a new journey for the development of the SCO.Thank you.";cctv.com;792;news;MY;en;['zhangrui'];https://p3.img.cctvpic.com/photoworkspace/2021/09/18/2021091807011487648.jpg;False;;13.253024;46a07c9752d365e558852dbb54899d50;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}
17;China and Latin America must use BRI to deepen cooperation: China Daily contributor;Yue Yunxia;2020-11-17 03:45:00;full;https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/china-and-latin-america-must-use-bri-to-deepen-cooperation-china-daily-contributor;straitstimes.com;The writer says that for China, Latin America is playing a more fundamental role in industrial and supply chains.. Read more at straitstimes.com.;"BEIJING (CHINA DAILY/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - As members of Brics, China and Brazil need to deepen cooperation to optimise the opportunities they share and meet the common challenges they face.
The two countries should also help elevate China-Latin America cooperation to a higher level.
Cooperation between China and Latin America has been deepening through the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, which comprises a five-pronged approach - policy coordination, infrastructure connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration, and enhancement of people-to-people ties. So China and Latin America can further expand cooperation through the Belt and Road Initiative to help the world to contain the Covid-19 pandemic and reboot the global economy, leading to normal, sustainable economic development.
An increasing number of people in Latin American countries realise the importance of the Belt and Road Initiative in not only domestic, but also regional and global development. Not least because, based on the spirit of mutual respect, win-win cooperation and inclusiveness, the Belt and Road projects are aimed at benefiting all participants.
In particular, the Belt and Road projects have won widespread praise because they have contributed to developing countries' economic growth, especially in infrastructure construction. As for China-Latin America cooperation through the Belt and Road, among the 24 Latin American countries with diplomatic relations with China, 19 have signed cooperation memorandums under the Belt and Road framework.
And the other five countries, including Brazil, Argentina and Colombia, are in talks on Belt and Road projects.
Chile and Panama, too, are trying to connect the Belt and Road projects, including Digital Silk Road, Green Silk Road and Innovative Silk Road, to their national planning mechanism.
That Chinese investment in Latin America has increased is good news for projects in energy and transportation among others. Also, policy communication has improved China-Latin America cooperation in new areas such as e-commerce and services, and the two sides are experiencing a structural change in trade, particularly in the higher levels of the value chain.
For China, Latin America is playing a more fundamental role in industrial and supply chains.
Data from Chinese customs show food and material imports from Latin America increased during the first quarter of this year when China was battling the worst phase of the novel coronavirus epidemic. These imports helped stabilise China's food supply.
And for Latin America, China is a large source of stable income. The pandemic has caused a sharp decline in Latin America's exports to the European Union and the United States, which have traditionally been Latin America's major trade partners, while its exports to China remained stable, even increasing slightly.
In fact, Brazil's soybean exports to China hit a record high in April and May.
The pandemic, ironically, has made China and Latin America realise each other's increasing importance given the growing risks to globalisation. The two sides have also realised that the inclusive Belt and Road Initiative will help them maintain stable and sustainable development.
Expanding cooperation in the post-pandemic era is in the mutual interest of China and Latin America. With the global economy facing both opportunities and challenges, the Belt and Road's multidimensional development policy can be used to further expand trade and economic exchanges between China and Latin America.
For example, the Silk Road of Health and the Digital Silk Road can help develop the industries that have been beneficial to people during the pandemic, including food, pharmaceuticals, and mobile apps and video games.
The Belt and Road Initiative can also help the two sides strengthen their policy communication and coordination, in order to deal with the short-term risks at a time when the pandemic has given rise to an unprecedentedly complicated global situation.
For instance, the Belt and Road mechanism can help upgrade and expand China-Latin America cooperation and avoid systemic risks.
Besides, if China and Latin America further deepen cooperation under the Belt and Road framework in third-party markets, and between governments and social capital, the outflow effect will allow the two sides to share the gains with more parties.
And President Xi Jinping's participation in the upcoming meetings of Brics and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the G20 summit is expected to further boost China-Latin America cooperation.

Read more at straitstimes.com.;"The big infrastructure plan unveiled by President Joe Biden last week is meant to do more than revive America's decaying infrastructure and create jobs.
The United States would like to prove that democracies can do big projects and challenge Beijing's all-but-official stance that the West is in a long-term decline.
Other countries around the world are also looking to ramp up spending to steal a march on their competitors. The Straits Times takes a look at competitive infrastructure plays around the world and the political and economic calculus driving them.  Biden plan challenges US to define its future 

US President Joe Biden's American Jobs Plan is not only notable for finally attempting an ambitious injection of funds into America's decaying infrastructure.
It has an ideological agenda as well - to demonstrate, as China looms in the rearview mirror, that democracies are better than autocracies in renewing themselves and delivering for their people. The plan is also not just about lead pipes, roads and bridges or even high-speed Internet.

China reinvents Belt and Road in pandemic era 

The pandemic has put a kink in President Xi Jinping's signature Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), as supply chains are disrupted and countries battered by the outbreak delay and even suspend projects. The havoc wreaked by Covid-19 and the bad press surrounding this ambitious modern-day Silk Road - linking Asia, Europe and Africa via land and sea routes - have forced Beijing to restrategise, positioning the BRI as a ""Green Silk Road"", ""Health Silk Road"" and ""Digital Silk Road"".
Data tabulated by the Green Belt and Road Initiative Centre at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing showed Chinese investments in Belt and Road countries last year were US$47 billion (S$63 billion), 54 per cent less than the year before.

Infrastructure cooperation in third countries on Japan PM Suga's mind 

Infrastructure cooperation in third countries will likely be on the agenda when Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga becomes the first world leader to meet United States President Joe Biden at the White House on Friday (April 16).
The two security allies are working together - under the umbrella of the Free and Open Indo-Pacific vision - to counter China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) that is seen as a strategy for Beijing to expand its diplomatic and economic influence.
Japan's Yomiuri newspaper, citing sources, said Mr Biden and Mr Suga will likely discuss the export of next-generation infrastructure such as 5G telecommunication network and green technology, as well as the development of smart cities.

Indonesian govt won't let Covid-19 derail much-needed projects

Steep inclines and sharp turns have become a thing of the past for motorists on Indonesia's Sumatra island after the first highway there opened last September.
Travelling 360km on a completed stretch of the highway - between the busy Bakauheni seaport in the southernmost province of Lampung and Palembang city - took 10 hours, or six hours shorter than on normal roads.
""Our rides are smoother now. We no longer have to experience sharp turns, and go up and down steep slopes,"" Mr Andika, who goes by one name, told The Straits Times. The 45-year-old owns a fleet of trucks transporting industrial equipment between the two locations.

Tap private partnerships in Indonesia to boost public services

It may have passed with little fanfare, but Indonesia inaugurated its first commercial project in March to deliver piped water to households, reflecting the country's growing ease with relying on private companies to deliver services on behalf of the government.
When it reaches full capacity, the 2 trillion rupiah (S$184 million) Umbulan Drinking Water Utility in East Java will pipe water for washing and cooking to 310,000 households throughout five districts south-east of Surabaya.
The project relies on an 818 billion rupiah top-up from the central government that makes up the shortfall between what the utility needs to be commercially viable and what the area's mostly rural customer base is thought to be able to afford.

India's road construction part of drive to better compete with China

India last year built 36.4km of highway roads per day, up from 28.04km per day the previous year, in what Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari described as a world record in a year of disruptions.
The Covid-19 pandemic saw the country go into a 21-day nationwide lockdown in March last year that brought economic activity to a grinding halt.
Road construction is just one part of a government-planned infrastructure push to boost exports and attract foreign companies to the country to better compete with China.

20;China-Asean Digital Silk Road under construction: China Daily contributor;Zhai Kun;2021-07-26 06:30:00;timezone unknown;https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-asean-digital-silk-road-under-construction-china-daily-contributor;straitstimes.com;East Asia News -The writer says that a good digital governance framework is needed for both global and regional development.. Read more at straitstimes.com.;"BEIJING (CHINA DAILY/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Data is in a stage of rapid growth. According to Statista, an international data organisation, the amount of data generated worldwide reached 59 zettabytes (59 trillion gigabytes) in 2020 and may increase about 35 times by 2035.

The economic value created by data is also booming. According to an International Data Corporation forecast in 2019, the global data market will feature three major players by 2025 - with the Chinese data market accounting for about 28 per cent of the pie; the United States about 17.5 per cent; and the Europe, Middle East and Africa region about 27.6 per cent.

Platform-based multinational corporations are also growing rapidly and becoming monopolistic by controlling user data. At the end of 2019, there were about 74 leading digital platform businesses in the world, of which 35 were US companies and 30 Chinese. However, the US has obvious comparative advantages in terms of market value, with US digital platforms accounting for 74.1 per cent of the global total, while Chinese platforms account for 22.5 per cent.

The rapid development of the data economy has given rise to new forms of geopolitical competition. Countries and businesses can analyse and predict macroeconomic and social trends in other countries based on massive data collection and collation. However, with data protectionism on the rise, countries are increasingly opting for data encapsulation, access restrictions, and regulatory policies.

In April 2020, the US Agency for International Development released its first ever Digital Strategy, which seeks to build a US-led international digital ecosystem through digital aid, which adopts ""US values"" as the norm for digital foreign aid and attempts to build a US-centred international digital alliance.

Some of the claims made in the strategy are confusing, such as ""helping partner countries achieve self-reliance"", which is in fact aimed at building an international digital alliance to maintain the interests of the US, based on US technological strength.

On the back of its huge data market and advantages in data economy, the EU seeks to gain a greater say in the international digital rule-making and erect barriers to its data market by introducing the ""gatekeeping"" draft law, increasing its budget allocation for the digital sector, and beginning research into 6G standards, with an aim of laying the foundation for long-term development in the digital area.

The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue tech network, which was launched in Canberra on Feb 9, may lead to new changes in the international digital landscape. Participants include the National Security College of Australian National University; the Centre for a New American Security, a US think tank; Japan's National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies and the Observer Research Foundation, an Indian think tank.

With the establishment of the Quad tech network, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue is gradually expanding its focus from conventional security to digital, network and other non-conventional security fields, which will also help refine the US' Indo-Pacific strategy by including the digital sector.

Digitally small and medium-sized countries have also signed digital economy agreements and digital currency agreements to build secondary digital alliances away from China, the US and the European Union. The signing of such agreements represents a new phase for global economic alliances. A network of digital economy agreements led by Singapore has been established. There are also constant calls for secondary digital partnerships.

At present, the Asia-Pacific region has become a major arena for digital competition, with South-east Asia in the spotlight for major powers thanks to the huge potential of its digital economy, in which China plays a crucial role. For geopolitical reasons, South-east Asia is indispensable for the Indo-Pacific strategy of the US and the EU, as well as the formation of secondary digital partnerships and the development of the global digital economy, since it will become the fourth largest digital market in the world, behind China, the US and Europe.

As global digital competition intensifies, a good digital governance framework is needed for both global and regional development, which is precisely the point of building the China-Asean Digital Silk Road.

China is strengthening its digital economy cooperation with the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean), having established a ministerial dialogue mechanism for digital economy cooperation with Thailand, signed Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) on e-commerce cooperation with Vietnam and Cambodia respectively, and started negotiations on a bilateral memorandum of understanding on cross-border e-commerce cooperation with Malaysia.

China is also actively involved in the construction of digital infrastructure in Asean countries, with the launch of Alibaba Cloud in Indonesia in 2018 and its expansion in 2020. Besides, Chinese businesses partner with local Asean companies mostly through equity investment and mergers and acquisitions. China was the largest source of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) for Asean tech startups from 2016 to the first half of 2019.

One of the key factors for China-Asean digital economy cooperation is cross-border data cooperation, which may serve as the catalyst for their greater strategic synergy. It is advisable that China and South-east Asian countries negotiate digital trade agreements while China and Asean set up a regional data and digital technology collaboration mechanism to drive digital cooperation in the form of industry- and business-led Asean integration.

In East Asia, China, together with Asean and Singapore, may design a regional digital currency package which includes the digital currencies of the Republic of Korea, Japan and Singapore for a China-Asean digital currency toolbox to facilitate flows of capital and data and build a new digital governance model in the region.

In the future, multilateral diplomacy may also be leveraged via the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and China-EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment for a China-Asean-EU trilateral cooperation platform to shape a broader area for international cooperation on the digital economy and its governance. Countries such as Japan and the Republic of Korea may also be included in due course to further extend the East Asian cooperation model on the digital economy.";straitstimes.com;1098;news;ID;en;['Zhai Kun'];https://static.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/x_large/public/articles/2021/07/26/2021-07-20t035725z_2034684618_rc23oo98e8k3_rtrmadp_3_china-regulation-data.jpg?itok=Z2GXuMeO;False;@STCOM;22.52583;823cccb8d6f92e6d6b91021748641c05;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

Read more at straitstimes.com.;"BEIJING (CHINA DAILY/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Addressing the Boao Forum for Asia through video link on Tuesday (April 20), President Xi Jinping said the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a public road open to all, not a private path owned by one single party.
By 2030, Belt and Road projects could help lift 7.6 million people from extreme poverty and 32 million people from moderate poverty across the world, Mr Xi said, citing a World Bank report.
""We will act in the spirit of openness and inclusiveness as we work with all willing participants to build the BRI into a pathway to poverty alleviation and growth, which will contribute positively to the common prosperity of humankind,"" he said. Themed ""A World in Change: Join Hands to Strengthen Global Governance and Advance Belt and Road Cooperation"", the ongoing annual conference of the Boao Forum for Asia 2021 is aimed at deepening cooperation among Asian countries and improving global governance in the post-pandemic period.
The theme of the conference being held in Hainan province from Sunday to Wednesday is indicative of how Asia, and the rest of the world, can recover from the pandemic-induced economic recession and boost development through cooperation.
China proposed the Belt and Road Initiative to cope with the anti-globalisation trend in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, and improve connectivity among related countries and regions through infrastructure construction, and free and open trade. Indeed, the initiative has played an important role in boosting the regional and global economies.
For instance, China-Europe freight trains transported anti-pandemic medicines and equipment as well as other products in 2020 even when many countries were under lockdown.
Also, trade between China and the European Union increased amid the global recession, with China replacing the United States to become the EU's largest trade partner.
Besides, China's non-financial direct investment in Belt and Road countries in 2020 reached US$17.79 billion (S$23.5 billion), up 18.3 per cent year-on-year, which proves the initiative has been facilitating economic and trade development. However, in the post-epidemic period, the Belt and Road cooperation mechanism needs to be further improved in order to promote more balanced economic development.
To begin with, since the 10 Asean member states, and China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia and New Zealand have inked the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement, they should accelerate the process of ratifying the pact to build a high-quality free trade network in the Asia-Pacific region with the aim of helping boost global economic growth.
The digital economy is another sector that has drawn increasing attention since the novel coronavirus pandemic broke out.
The combination of artificial intelligence, 5G technology, big data and cloud computing can give rise to new consumption and economic growth patterns.
And with digital payment and digital currency becoming increasingly popular, countries will discuss how to avoid potential risks and strengthen international coordination on risk management.
And the ""Digital Silk Road"", an important part of the Belt and Road Initiative, can help countries build digital infrastructure and facilitate their digital transformation.
As achieving sustainable development remains a challenge, the major goal of global governance should be to promote ""green recovery"" and realise the 17 goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
And since Asia is a densely populated region, Asian approaches should be explored to realise global sustainable development centred on green and circular economy, and focused more on regional development, including poverty reduction, rural sustainable development, using and protecting seas and marine resources, and plastic recycling.
While unilateralism and trade protectionism - along with the pandemic - have pushed the global economy into recession and destabilised the global financial system, it's important for Asia and the rest of the world to help build a consensus among major countries to promote multilateralism in global governance by defending the global trade order with the World Trade Organisation at its core.
The WTO member states, on their part, should help the global trade body to adapt to the changes in the global economy, especially the technology revolution and global trade and investment rules.
And the WTO needs to ensure all its member states can benefit from its organisational reform.
There is also a need to improve the international monetary and financing systems, and increase global coordination to strengthen financial support to emerging markets and developing countries, and establish a sustainable fund-raising system.
And improving connectivity and increasing investment in the Asian and global financial markets will facilitate the development of the financial sector.
In short, by helping improve the economic situation in the region, the Belt and Road Initiative will contribute to Asia's development and global recovery.

By 2030, Belt and Road projects could help lift 7.6 million people from extreme poverty and 32 million people from moderate poverty across the world, Mr Xi said, citing a World Bank report.
""We will act in the spirit of openness and inclusiveness as we work with all willing participants to build the BRI into a pathway to poverty alleviation and growth, which will contribute positively to the common prosperity of humankind,"" he said. Themed ""A World in Change: Join Hands to Strengthen Global Governance and Advance Belt and Road Cooperation"", the ongoing annual conference of the Boao Forum for Asia 2021 is aimed at deepening cooperation among Asian countries and improving global governance in the post-pandemic period.
The theme of the conference being held in Hainan province from Sunday to Wednesday is indicative of how Asia, and the rest of the world, can recover from the pandemic-induced economic recession and boost development through cooperation.
China proposed the Belt and Road Initiative to cope with the anti-globalisation trend in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, and improve connectivity among related countries and regions through infrastructure construction, and free and open trade. Indeed, the initiative has played an important role in boosting the regional and global economies.
For instance, China-Europe freight trains transported anti-pandemic medicines and equipment as well as other products in 2020 even when many countries were under lockdown.
Also, trade between China and the European Union increased amid the global recession, with China replacing the United States to become the EU's largest trade partner.
Besides, China's non-financial direct investment in Belt and Road countries in 2020 reached US$17.79 billion (S$23.5 billion), up 18.3 per cent year-on-year, which proves the initiative has been facilitating economic and trade development. However, in the post-epidemic period, the Belt and Road cooperation mechanism needs to be further improved in order to promote more balanced economic development.
To begin with, since the 10 Asean member states, and China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia and New Zealand have inked the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement, they should accelerate the process of ratifying the pact to build a high-quality free trade network in the Asia-Pacific region with the aim of helping boost global economic growth.
The digital economy is another sector that has drawn increasing attention since the novel coronavirus pandemic broke out.
The combination of artificial intelligence, 5G technology, big data and cloud computing can give rise to new consumption and economic growth patterns.
And with digital payment and digital currency becoming increasingly popular, countries will discuss how to avoid potential risks and strengthen international coordination on risk management.
And the ""Digital Silk Road"", an important part of the Belt and Road Initiative, can help countries build digital infrastructure and facilitate their digital transformation.
As achieving sustainable development remains a challenge, the major goal of global governance should be to promote ""green recovery"" and realise the 17 goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
And since Asia is a densely populated region, Asian approaches should be explored to realise global sustainable development centred on green and circular economy, and focused more on regional development, including poverty reduction, rural sustainable development, using and protecting seas and marine resources, and plastic recycling.
While unilateralism and trade protectionism - along with the pandemic - have pushed the global economy into recession and destabilised the global financial system, it's important for Asia and the rest of the world to help build a consensus among major countries to promote multilateralism in global governance by defending the global trade order with the World Trade Organisation at its core.
The WTO member states, on their part, should help the global trade body to adapt to the changes in the global economy, especially the technology revolution and global trade and investment rules.
And the WTO needs to ensure all its member states can benefit from its organisational reform.
There is also a need to improve the international monetary and financing systems, and increase global coordination to strengthen financial support to emerging markets and developing countries, and establish a sustainable fund-raising system.
And improving connectivity and increasing investment in the Asian and global financial markets will facilitate the development of the financial sector.
In short, by helping improve the economic situation in the region, the Belt and Road Initiative will contribute to Asia's development and global recovery.

23;Activists fear rising surveillance from Asia's 'Digital Silk Road';;2022-09-19 01:25:41;full;https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/activists-fear-rising-surveillance-from-asias-digital-silk-road;straitstimes.com;As China drives adoption of surveillance tech, state AI-based systems target activists, protesters. Read more at straitstimes.com.;"PHNOM PENH - The drones were hard to avoid: They buzzed low over the crowd of protesters holding banners and shouting slogans outside the NagaWorld casino in the Cambodian city of Phnom Penh, then hovered above each of the speakers as they called for justice.
As hundreds of workers went on strike outside the glass and chrome towers of the firm's hotel and casino complex, demanding the reinstatement of nearly 400 employees who were laid off last year, armed riot police and surveillance cameras kept watch.
""We knew we were being recorded, but we couldn't do anything, so we would wave at the drones,"" said Ms Chhim Sithar, 34, a union leader who was arrested at the January protest along with more than a dozen others, and held in jail for nine weeks. Hong Kong-listed NagaCorp said the strike that began in December was illegal, and that the layoffs were a ""mutual separation plan"" to cut costs during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Municipal police have said the workers' strike was illegal and a threat to public order and safety. Police charged some protesters with ""incitement to cause serious chaos to social security"".
Ms Chhim Sithar and other Cambodian rights activists say they are under constant surveillance, their every move online and offline tracked by software, cameras and drones. Much of the technology is supplied by China, which sells extensive digital surveillance packages to governments under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) infrastructure project. Chinese President Xi Jinping launched BRI in 2013, aiming to harness China's strengths in financing and infrastructure construction to ""build a broad community of shared interests"" across Asia, Africa and Latin America.
China has installed more than 1,000 CCTV cameras in Phnom Penh as part of a new nationwide surveillance system, according to local media reports.
Cambodian government spokesman Phay Siphan denied that the technologies are used to target activists and union leaders. ""The CCTVs and other surveillance infrastructure are for security purposes, to fight crime, and traffic violations and other illegal actions,"" he told Reuters.
China influence
While the authorities justify surveillance on security grounds, human rights groups have raised concerns about privacy violations and the potential for profiling and discrimination, with the technologies often deployed without public consultation, and in the absence of strong data protection laws.
Countries taking part in BRI are using technologies, including artificial intelligence-based facial recognition systems linked to abuse of minority Uighurs in China for smart policing or smart cities programmes, and digital tools for monitoring social media sites.
""These tools offer new possibilities for tracking and intimidating dissenters, monitoring political opponents, and preempting challenges to the government,"" said Mr Steven Feldstein, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think-tank based in Washington.
""In authoritarian settings, these capabilities have obvious potential to deepen repression,"" said Mr Feldstein, who estimates that Chinese artificial intelligence surveillance technologies are being rolled out in more than 50 BRI countries.
A key part of China's BRI programme is the so-called Digital Silk Road - an initiative that aims to build modern telecom and data infrastructure among nations lying on the ancient Silk Road trade route.
Chinese involvement ranges from its tech firms building submarine internet cables, data centres and mobile towers, to nations copying its cyber laws and Internet gateways to control the flow of data and information, said a recent report by the Alliance to Secure Democracy (ASD), a US-based think-tank.
""There is a risk that the Chinese state may be able to amass data - whether it's genetic surveillance information or more traditional information about political opinions or activity through these systems,"" said Ms Lindsay Gorman, a senior fellow for emerging technologies at ASD.
""There is a real question about where the data that fuels these surveillance systems is stored, who owns it and who benefits from it,"" she said.
Chinese authorities have said tech monitoring is vital to combat crime and prevent the spread of Covid-19, and has denied reports that it is using tech to enable abuse of Uighurs.
'We are all afraid'
In Myanmar, where the military overthrew an elected government last year and launched a bloody crackdown on protests and dissent, Chinese firms are deploying 4G and 5G networks, as well as facial recognition systems in several cities.
The junta has adopted cyber laws that echo China's, including limiting Internet access to certain websites and banning social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.
A spokesperson for the junta did not respond to a request for comment. Officials earlier said facial recognition systems are needed to maintain security and ""civil peace"".
But reports of the use of CCTV and facial recognition to target protesters have made Hsu, a lawyer who provides legal aid to political prisoners in the city of Mandalay, ""more afraid"".
""The police submit CCTV records as evidence in the court, so we know it is dangerous for the activists,"" said Hsu, 26, using a pseudonym for fear of reprisal. ""When I went to prison to meet with jailed activists, I would wear a mask - not because I was scared of COVID-19, but because I wanted to hide my face. ""We are all afraid of the CCTV.""
Being watched
Worldwide, the rise of AI technologies have led to the proliferation of mass surveillance systems, including face recognition and voice identification for a range of uses, from tracking criminals to marking student attendance.
""Technology has changed the nature of how governments carry out surveillance and what they choose to monitor,"" said Mr Feldstein.
In Cambodia, where the authorities are building a national internet gateway - similar to China's Internet firewall that blocks websites and social media platforms - there is little transparency around these systems, said Ms Chak Sopheap at the Cambodian Centre for Human Rights, a nonprofit.
""The government has disclosed no information as to the data gathered, and how they are used by the authorities. This lack of transparency is highly problematic,"" she said. ""The use of such technologies affects the right to privacy of people, especially those who do not support the government, and provides Cambodian authorities with an additional tool to crack down on critical voices and dissidents.""
In Phnom Penh, labour leader Chhim Sithar and her fellow protesters are adapting: They do more in-person meetings, where they turn off their phones, they use virtual private networks and encrypted chat groups and refrain from posting on social media.
""This feeling of being watched and tracked all the time is exhausting,"" she said. ""We cannot do anything without the police knowing - it's scary.""

Read more at straitstimes.com.;"WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - The United States aims to raise US$200 billion (S$280 billion) in private and public funds over five years to fund needed infrastructure in developing countries under a G-7 initiative aimed at countering China's multitrillion-dollar Belt and Road project, the White House said on Sunday (June 26).
US President Joe Biden will unveil the plans, flanked by other Group of Seven leaders, some of whom have already unveiled their own separate initiatives, at their annual gathering being held this year at Schloss Elmau in southern Germany.
Increasingly worried about China, G-7 leaders first floated plans for the project last year, and are formally launching it now under a fresh title, ""Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment"" while dropping the moniker ""Build Back Better World"" first coined by Biden during his presidential campaign. Mr Biden will unveil several specific projects at a G-7 side event, joined by leaders from Britain, Germany, Japan, the European Union and Canada, vowing to focus on projects that help tackle climate change as well as improve global health, gender equity and digital infrastructure.
Notably absent will be French President Emmanuel Macron who had formally joined the Chinese infrastructure program.
""The president's not thinking that we need to spend dollar for dollar versus China ... though if you add up what the US and the G-7 partners are going to be announcing, it comes pretty close to the number,"" one senior US official told reporters. The funds would be raised through grants and federal funds, and by leveraging private-sector investments, the White House said, adding that hundreds of billions of additional dollars could come from multilateral development banks, development finance institutions, sovereign wealth funds and others. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) scheme, which Chinese President Xi Jinping launched in 2013, involves development and investment initiatives in over 100 countries, with a range of projects including railways, ports and highways.
White House officials say Mr Xi's plan to create a modern version of the ancient Silk Road trade route has provided little tangible benefit for many developing countries, with top jobs going to Chinese workers, while increasing rates of forced and child labour.
Biden will highlight several flagship projects, including a US$2 billion solar development project in Angola with support from the Commerce Department, the US Export-Import Bank, US firm AfricaGlobal Schaffer, and US project developer Sun Africa.
Together with G-7 members and the EU, Washington will also provide US$3.3 million in technical assistance to Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal as it develops an industrial-scale flexible multi-vaccine manufacturing facility in that country that can eventually produce Covid-19 and other vaccines.
The US Agency for International Development (USAID) will also commit up to US$50 million over five years to the World Bank's new global Childcare Incentive Fund, a project aimed at address the gap in suitable childcare infrastructure.";straitstimes.com;1098;world;ID;en;;https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2022/06/26/YU_GROUP7.jpg?VersionId=v8cyiHoCQC2DxRbr3Z3vY2iZO74z0JM4;False;@straits_times;19.914307;36a7b11899b3fec85a8d04aca9fd7f62;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

Covid-19 spikes in Asia

The world's biggest continent is struggling to contain a resurgence of coronavirus infections, with less than 100 days to go before it is due to host the Olympics in Japan. The Straits Times' bureaus around the region look into the reasons for the rebound in cases.  In Japan, pleas to avoid non-essential outings have been ignored by politicians and bureaucrats, and streets are teeming with people again even as infections rise, Japan correspondent Walter Sim reports. The Malaysian government has relaxed social distancing rules for the Ramadan fasting month, though new cases remain stubbornly above 1,000 on most days, Malaysia correspondent Hazlin Hassan writes. In India, which is experiencing a massive new wave of infections, people were simply confused by contradictory messaging as mass gatherings were taking place even while officials threatened lockdowns, says India bureau chief Nirmala Ganapathy.

The troubles facing Umno president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi appear to fuel the premiership ambitions of his 'clean' deputy Mohamad Hasan, says Malaysia bureau chief Shannon Teoh. 
The recent leak of an audio clip purportedly of Zahid conspiring with opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim - if authentic - lays bare the pair's joint efforts to wrest power from Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin. Zahid is also facing 87 charges of corruption. Calls are growing for him to step down and hand over the reins to his deputy. But Mr Mohamad, while fairly popular within the party, may lack a firm grip on the influential warlords within the group. 
Malaysia's most stable political party, the opposition Democratic Action Party, is also in a state of flux as it debates whether to 'dilute its Chineseness' to gain the acceptance and support of Malay voters. Meanwhile, the opposition pact, Pakatan Harapan, last week named Datuk Seri Anwar as its prime ministerial candidate for the next general election, Malaysia correspondent Hazlin Hassan reports.

Therefore, PineBridge Investments believes it's time for international investors and business leaders to view Asia through a fresh framework.
After three growth waves spanning many decades – from post-war Japan to the industrialisation of the East Asian Tigers and, more recently, China's rise – Asia is now moving away from supply-chain-based economies. Like never before, its young and growing consumer class is leveraging converging trends as digital technology combines with demographic advantages and policy improvements. The fourth growth wave now building could culminate by pulling the world's economic centre of gravity east, just as the global balance of power is shifting to a multipolar world where technological, economic and geopolitical power is not concentrated in the hands of a single country, territory or region.
For business leaders and investors to effectively position for Asia's long-term opportunities, PineBridge believes it will be key to understand the context and the dynamics of underlying trends in the region and how they impact the rest of the world. Here, the firm shares three consequential developments that investors and business leaders should be watching closely. The fourth wave. 
With a nearly 700 million-strong population, South-east Asia is poised to produce 140 million new young consumers, nearly a fifth of the world's total, over the next decade.1 The rise of South-east Asia's economies converging with China's continued economic momentum will power the fourth wave of growth in Asia.
South-east Asia is benefiting from previous growth waves and from Chinese investments. Despite Covid-19-induced challenges, the Beijing-led Belt and Road Initiative continues to provide a platform for upgrading critical infrastructure in the region, with China's priority seemingly evolving towards more green-energy projects and technology-related investments, with talk of a 'green silk road' and 'digital silk road'.2,3 Asia's Infra King: China

Once confined to outsourced manufacturing or accused of copying Western technology, Asian companies are increasingly category-definers. China's largest tech companies compete internationally in artificial intelligence, cloud computing and entertainment. While Chinese regulators have recently stepped up scrutiny on some tech business models, causing short-term uncertainty for the sector, the long-term arc still looks to bend in China's economic favour. The world was already in an upcycle of digitalisation and automation pre-Covid-19, and that transition could further benefit Asia. Singapore, South Korea and Japan, for example, already lead the world in robot density in manufacturing.
Governments are also pioneering digital innovation in everything from identification to currencies. A shift to digital currencies could represent a big leap for financial inclusion and consumer spending – again bolstering the region's overall economic clout.
The green energy revolution. 
Ninety-nine of the world's 100 most environmentally exposed cities are in Asia, as are 13 of the top 20 cities projected to suffer a major increase in losses from flooding.4,5 This makes a 'green transition' an urgent priority.
According to Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Asia-Pacific investment over the next 20 years will bring 2,673GW of renewable energy online by 2040, more than double Europe's projected installed capacity and over three times that in North America over the same period.6
China, still the largest carbon emitter in the world,7 also has the world's largest battery electric-vehicle (EV) market and is projected to see the sharpest growth in the years ahead, with 2014-2015 marking a key turning point relative to the US market.

An Asia-centric destiny?
That's not to say that Asia's path is fully paved. The US-China tensions, Beijing's own regulatory reforms to promote greater social equality, Covid-19's continued threat and climate change are all sources of uncertainty.
The geopolitical flare-up between the world's two largest economies is having complex repercussions, driving investment into other countries as multinationals de-risk their China operations and forcing technology buyers and sellers to consider separate tech stacks, which could balloon everyone's costs.
China's heightened scrutiny of activities it deems counter to 'common prosperity' may suggest a volatile business environment for investors. However, in the long run, the impact may be positive on the whole.
We can't predict the future. However, PineBridge believes that the weight of evidence tilts towards the age of Asia, with compelling opportunities for discerning investors. This is a long-term story set to play out over a decade or more as China edges into the No. 1 spot on GDP charts and South-east Asia's young workers, consumers and entrepreneurs push the region to become a key source of influence in a multipolar world.

Read more at straitstimes.com.;"SINGAPORE - Given Cambodia's vibrant trade environment and consistent growth over the last decade, there are many opportunities there for Singapore-based firms and international partners to explore projects to boost regional connectivity.
This was the key theme of a roundtable organised by Infrastructure Asia and Singapore's YCH Group on Tuesday (April 20) to connect local logistics firms with potential partners to develop and finance the Phnom Penh Logistics Complex (PPLC).
Plans for the PPLC, which is estimated to cost US$200 million (S$265 million), include an integrated port and logistics operations centre, training academy and start-up hub. A framework agreement to develop the project was inked last month between the logistics company and Cambodia's Ministry of Public Works and Transport.
More than 30 representatives from Surbana Jurong, DBS Bank, OCBC Bank, Clifford Capital, China Construction Bank, the International Finance Corporation and Silk Road Fund, among others, attended the roundtable in person and virtually.
Stressing the collaborative nature of the PPLC, Infrastructure Asia executive director Seth Tan said a critical success factor is the Cambodian government's involvement - from earmarking land to develop the port, to setting up meetings between YCH and government agencies to better understand the project details. ""The collaboration between the (Cambodian) government and YCH is quite extensive, and it is this element that gives it a higher chance of success and minimises costs as well,"" he said.
Infrastructure Asia, a joint initiative by Enterprise Singapore and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, was set up to connect governments with developers, professional service providers and financiers for the region's infrastructure needs.
The PPLC is part of the Smart Growth Connect Initiative by the Asean Business Advisory Council.
It is the second project under the Asean Smart Logistics Network, which supports the Asean Connectivity Master Plan 2025 - a road map to seamlessly connect and integrate the regional bloc. The first project, launched in November and also helmed by YCH, is a joint venture with Vietnam's T&T Group to develop a logistics centre and port in Vietnam.
The PPLC stands to boost Cambodia's economic growth and connectivity, especially with the Mekong region and south-western China.
Contract preparation and groundbreaking for the project are slated to take place in 2022, which is also the year in which Cambodia will assume the rotating chairmanship of Asean.
Singapore firms have been making forays into Cambodia over the years.
In January, local waste management company 800 Super, with its joint venture partner in Cambodia GAEA Waste Management, was awarded a 10-year contract for waste collection and transportation in the country's capital Phnom Penh. YCH Group chairman Robert Yap said that Cambodia has consistently registered high single-digit gross domestic product growth and has the potential to go further.
""Cambodia's logistics infrastructure is not that well developed today, which is why many multinational companies' distribution centres are in other countries such as Thailand or Vietnam,"" he explained.
""Having consulted some of our customers running supply chains in Asean, I think they would put their distribution facilities in Cambodia if the country were to have a world-class standard of infrastructure. So this is an opportunity for Cambodia to be in the game.""
He added that YCH's plan is to roll out similar projects in other Asean countries.
""Such projects are multimodal in nature and connect land, air and sea.

Others will recall the 1978 work Drying Salted Fish, which appears on the back of Singapore's $50 note.
But the pioneer master's practice was more diverse and innovative than casual observers give him credit for.
""People always think of Soo Pieng's art as one of two types - the 1950s Nanyang style or the thin-limbed Balinese ladies,"" says Mr Ho Sou Ping, 49, founder of Artcommune gallery. ""That's only like 5 per cent of his practice. People have a superficial view of Soo Pieng, but his work is so rich, so diverse."" To encourage the public to learn more about this pioneer Singapore artist, Mr Ho's gallery is mounting a retrospective of more than 100 of Cheong's ink works.
Tonalities: The Ink Works Of Cheong Soo Pieng opens at Artspace@Helutrans in Tanjong Pagar Distripark tomorrow and runs till June 13.
In recent years, a number of the master's classicist ink paintings from 1978 to 1982 - on paper, silk, cloth and canvas - have surfaced, Mr Ho says. This allowed the gallery to do more research on this understudied phase and ""flesh out a comprehensive narrative arc"". The exhibition features ink works from the early 1950s to 1983 and covering four themes - portraiture, landscape, Europe and ""Nanyang scrolls"". They are on loan from more than 20 collectors and nearly half are being exhibited for the first time.
Tonalities is curated by Mr Tan Yong Jun, 28. The independent researcher and curator, who recently wrote a book about the artist, says: ""Cheong Soo Pieng's ink works are often overshadowed by his oil and canvas works. There's a variety of reasons for this, not least the fine arts' prejudice against paper works.""
Cheong also did a lot of innovative work in oil and mixed media, metal and cloisonne in the late 1960s and early 1970s, so it is ""understandable that these would define that period of Soo Pieng's career"", says Mr Tan.
But the ink works from that period are ""very interesting"", he says. ""His kampungs became in the style of - if you want to peg it to an art movement - lyrical abstraction."" Cheong had left for Europe in 1961 under the patronage of Cathay cinema magnate Loke Wan Tho. He continued making art there, including a series of ink and oil works shown in a breakthrough solo show at London's Redfern Gallery in 1963.

The Europe works are also known as the ""Zao Wou-Ki series"" - given their similarities with works by the Chinese-French artist - and are shown alongside old sketches, news articles and other contemporary material in the Artcommune show.
""Before this, Soo Pieng's works were more strict in formalism and adhered to received ideas about modern painting,"" says Mr Tan. ""After that, his vision was broadened and he became comfortable seeking his own painterly road to modernity.""
Back in Singapore in 1963, he moved away from his Cubist styles of the 1950s and painted kampungs that were atmospheric rather than realistic.
Mr Tan calls them ""surrealist-inspired mindscapes"". The artist, he adds, could have been hinting that such scenes, amid the rapid urbanisation of Singapore, were present only in his mind.
Cheong has long been hailed as one of Singapore's greatest artists.
He was born in Amoy, China, in 1917. He migrated to Singapore in 1946 at the age of 29 and taught at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts.
Like other pioneer artists, he often painted in the Nanyang style, an East-meets-West aesthetic associated with artists from South-east Asia.
He was inspired by his travels, not just by the Europe trip, but also a seminal 1952 journey to Bali with fellow artists Liu Kang, Chen Wen Hsi and Chen Chong Swee, as well as a stay in a Borneo longhouse in 1959 that sparked a lifelong interest in the indigenous Dayak people.
His paintings of the Dayak people are shown in the exhibition.
Mr Tan, comparing them with the Balinese figures, thinks they show a deeper understanding of local culture. ""He had a very clear, concise and accurate idea of each Dayak tribe he painted. We could identify whether he was painting the Iban or Kenyah (tribes) based on the patterns they were wearing or the architecture of the long house.""
Cheong received many plaudits in his lifetime, including the Meritorious Service Medal for his contributions to Singapore art.
After embarking on a return trip to China in 1979, he delved deeper into Song Dynasty aesthetics in paintings that reimagined Chinese classicism. He also rolled out a series of Nanyang scrolls, which were often painted on South-east Asian materials such as rattan.
""Arts of the 1980s should include applied arts, include the representative arts of the Nanyang,"" Cheong wrote in a 1980 article in Chinese daily Sin Chew Jit Poh.
He added: ""The only way for a Nanyang style to emerge is to start working from these materials.""
Versatile artist a man of few words
In 1983, the National Museum Art Gallery organised a retrospective of Cheong's works.
Sadly, he did not live to see it. Four months before the exhibition, he died of heart failure at the age of 66.
In an article several months after his death, his second son Cheong Teng remarked: ""Out of 365 days of the year, he painted 360.""
The late artist was famously reticent - a journalist's nightmare, suggests one 1983 Straits Times article.
""He was a man of few words, he didn't talk much,"" former student Lin Hsin Hsin was quoted in the piece as saying. ""He did visual thinking and only talked when very interested in the subject.""
Lin, 69, is now a veteran digital artist whose works are part of ongoing National Gallery Singapore exhibition Something New Must Turn Up.
One of the challenges scholars face when they study Cheong is a dearth of primary information.
Mr Tan says: ""Until now, we have discovered a grand total of one article by him - as opposed to Liu Kang and Chen Chong Swee's writings, which have been made into books, or Chen Wen Hsi's lengthy oral histories. He was most comfortable explaining himself in his paintings.""
One of the art collectors who contributed to the show is Mr Francis Choo, 62, who lent the 1959 Borneo-inspired Long House.
""It struck me as a very typical Cheong Soo Pieng composition - very well-composed, extremely sensitive to the subject matter,"" says the vice-president of a multinational IT company.
""Cheong Soo Pieng is very versatile. He is probably the most well-rounded artist Singapore has produced,"" he adds.
Prominent architect and art lover Koh Seow Chuan notes the use of negative space in Cheong's 1980s Chinese ink paintings.
""He wanted to explore the limits of Song dynasty composition, of positiveness and negativeness, and how they coexist to make a painting you can meditate on,"" says Mr Koh in a video posted by the gallery. ""Beyond the visual - spiritual.""";straitstimes.com;1098;news;ID;en;[];https://static.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/x_large/public/articles/2021/05/13/ST_20210513_WLCHEONG13INK_6535138.jpg?itok=bNsu8tGC;False;;12.214272;3b79791b0401eaf2f1888b2d14437338;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

US President Joe Biden and other G7 leaders relaunched the newly renamed ""Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment,"" at their annual gathering being held this year at Schloss Elmau in southern Germany. Biden said the United States would mobilise US$200 billion in grants, federal funds and private investment over five years to support projects in low- and middle-income countries that help tackle climate change as well as improve global health, gender equity and digital infrastructure. ""I want to be clear. This isn't aid or charity. It's an investment that will deliver returns for everyone,"" Biden said, adding that it would allow countries to ""see the concrete benefits of partnering with democracies"". Biden said hundreds of billions of additional dollars could come from multilateral development banks, development finance institutions, sovereign wealth funds and others. Europe will mobilise €300 billion for the initiative over the same period to build up a sustainable alternative to China's Belt and Road Initiative scheme, which Chinese President Xi Jinping launched in 2013, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the gathering. The leaders of Italy, Canada and Japan also spoke about their plans, some of which have already been announced separately. French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson were not present, but their countries are also participating. China's investment scheme involves development and programs in over 100 countries aimed at creating a modern version of the ancient Silk Road trade route from Asia to Europe.

US President Joe Biden will unveil the plans, flanked by other Group of Seven leaders, some of whom have already unveiled their own separate initiatives, at their annual gathering being held this year at Schloss Elmau in southern Germany. Increasingly worried about China, G7 leaders first floated plans for the project last year, and are formally launching it now under a fresh title, ""Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment"" while dropping the moniker ""Build Back Better World"" first coined by Biden during his presidential campaign. Biden will unveil several specific projects at a G7 side event, joined by leaders from Britain, Germany, Japan, the European Union and Canada, vowing to focus on projects that help tackle climate change as well as improve global health, gender equity and digital infrastructure. Notably absent will be French President Emmanual Macron who had formally joined the Chinese infrastructure program. ""The president's not thinking that we need to spend dollar for dollar versus China ... though if you add up what the US and the G7 partners are going to be announcing, it comes pretty close to the number,"" one senior US official told reporters. The funds would be raised through grants and federal funds, and by leveraging private-sector investments, the White House said, adding that hundreds of billions of additional dollars could come from multilateral development banks, development finance institutions, sovereign wealth funds and others. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) scheme, which Chinese President Xi Jinping launched in 2013, involves development and investment initiatives in over 100 countries, with a range of projects including railways, ports and highways. White House officials say Xi's plan to create a modern version of the ancient Silk Road trade route has provided little tangible benefit for many developing countries, with top jobs going to Chinese workers, while increasing rates of forced and child labour. Biden will highlight several flagship projects, including a US$2 billion solar development project in Angola with support from the Commerce Department, the US Export-Import Bank, US firm AfricaGlobal Schaffer, and US project developer Sun Africa. Together with G7 members and the EU, Washington will also provide US$3.3 million in technical assistance to Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal as it develops an industrial-scale flexible multi-vaccine manufacturing facility in that country that can eventually produce COVID-19 and other vaccines. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) will also commit up to US$50 million over five years to the World Bank's new global Childcare Incentive Fund, a project aimed at address the gap in suitable childcare infrastructure.";channelnewsasia.com;1591;news;SG;en;;https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--bvO_o1kC--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:reuters,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/one-cms/core/2022-06-26t152124z_1_lynxmpei5p08u_rtroptp_3_g7-summit.jpg?itok=cVdu_DVA;False;@ChannelNewsAsia;20.413445;77d0336b87dbaa9f80b605734b897b59;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

U.S. President Joe Biden and other G7 leaders hope the plan, known as the Build Back Better World (B3W) initiative, will provide a transparent infrastructure partnership to help narrow the US$40 trillion needed by developing nations by 2035, the White House said.""This is not just about confronting or taking on China,"" a senior official in Biden's administration said. ""But until now we haven't offered a positive alternative that reflects our values, our standards and our way of doing business.""The G7 and its allies will use the initiative to mobilise private sector capital in areas such as climate, health and health security, digital technology, and gender equity and equality, the White House said.It was not immediately clear how the plan would exactly work or how much capital it would ultimately allocate. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure scheme that Xi launched in 2013, involving development and investment initiatives that would stretch from Asia to Europe and beyond.More than 100 countries have signed agreements with China to cooperate in BRI projects like railways, ports, highways and other infrastructure.Critics say Xi's plan to create a modern version of the ancient Silk Road trade route to link China with Asia, Europe and beyond is a vehicle for the expansion of Communist China. Beijing says such doubts betray the ""imperial hangover"" of many Western powers that humiliated China for centuries.CHINA'S RISE The re-emergence of China as a leading global power is considered to be one of the most significant geopolitical events of recent times, alongside the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union that ended the Cold War.China in 1979 had an economy that was smaller than Italy's, but after opening to foreign investment and introducing market reforms, it has become the world's second-largest economy and is a global leader in a range of new technologies.Leaders of the G7 - the United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, Italy, France and Japan - want to use their gathering in the seaside resort of Carbis Bay to show the world that the richest democracies can offer an alternative to China's growing clout.The U.S. official said until now, the West had failed to offer a positive alternative to the ""lack of transparency, poor environmental and labour standards, and coercive approach"" of the Chinese government that had left many countries worse off.According to a Refinitiv database, as of mid-last year, more than 2,600 projects at a cost of US$3.7 trillion were linked to the Belt and Road Initiative, although the Chinese foreign ministry said last June that about 20per cent of projects had been seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.As part of the G7 plan, the United States will work with the U.S. Congress to supplement existing development financing and to ""collectively catalyze hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investment,"" the White House said.FORCED LABOURThe United States is pushing the other G7 leaders for ""concrete action on forced labour"" in China, and to include criticism of Beijing in their final communique from a three-day summit in southwest England, the U.S. official said.Biden planned to press the other leaders to make clear that they believe forced labour practices are an affront to human dignity and ""an egregious example of China's unfair economic competition"".""We're pushing on being specific on areas like Xinjiang where forced labour is taking place and where we have to express our values as a G7,"" the official said of the final communique to be issued at the end of the summit on Sunday.China denies all accusations of abuse in the Xinjiang region.The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the G7 infrastructure proposal or the U.S. official's remarks about forced labour.(Reporting by Steve Holland and Michael Holden; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Frances Kerry)";channelnewsasia.com;1591;news;SG;en;[];https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/8695368/16x9/991/557/e9615d3f8fac5a826ae3bfa657aec6ec/or/business.png;False;@channelnewsasia;19.337364;39e7e5690bc00c100947b2682d33f4a6;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

For one, the B3W is not new.While hailed as a new initiative under the Joe Biden administration, the idea of an alternative infrastructure programme to China's was initiated under President Donald Trump ‘s administration under the ambit of the bipartisan Better Utilisation of Investments to Development At (BUILD) Act passed by the House and Senate and signed into law by Trump in 2018.READ: Commentary: G7 summit proved the world has shifted after TrumpREAD: Commentary: We need to talk about how Donald Trump's presidency wasn't a complete disaster BUILDING ON THE BUILD ACTCentral to the BUILD programme was less the objective of countering China and more the aim to encourage private sector investment into developing countries that would reduce the need for US foreign aid.The focus was on funding hard infrastructure, such as electricity, that would help less developed countries attract investment to grow their way out of poverty.The BUILD Act also had the mandate to invest up to US$60 billion in private sector investment to fight extreme poverty. The US would do this by converting the US Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) into a new international Development Finance Corporation (USIDFC) with modernised financing capabilities, including the ability to provide equity financing, local currency loans and guarantees. Then US President Donald Trump. (Photo: AFP/CHIP SOMODEVILLA) This new USIDFC, established under the BUILD Act, would make loans, invest in and forge partnerships with those wanting to do business in low- to middle-income countries as a minority investor.MOUDLING INTERNATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCINGIt was only in 2019 that the USIDFC gained international muscle through the mooting of a Blue Dot Network (BDN) in which the US joined forces with Japan and Australia but remained open to other countries joining the network in supporting high-quality, private sector led investments. Framed in terms of countering Chinese influence under an Indo-Pacific strategy, the BDN would indeed offer an alternative to China's BRI and tap into the US$1.3 trillion dollars in trade volume between China and the countries along the BRI in 2018.It would fill the demand for international infrastructure financing with a US model through mobilising private capital while giving governments skin in the game in mitigating endemic risks including political, legal and social risks.But it was clear the three countries couldn't do it on their own. Enter the B3W.The B3W is an extension of the BDN. At a high level, the B3W and BDN appear to be guided by similar policy and principal guidelines in meeting the development needs of the poorer countries subscribing to agreed standards like the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment endorsed in Osaka in 2019.By mobilising private sector capital, the B3W's funding is aimed at addressing four specific areas (i.e., climate, health, digital technology, and gender equity), enlisting an 'alliance of democracies' to project soft power driven by common values, good governance and established standards.READ: Commentary: The US needs a new China strategyREAD: Commentary: Joe Biden's quietly revolutionary first 100 daysIndeed, the B3W announcement has been positioned as a 'democratic' alternative to the BRI and a foreign policy move by the US to showcase President Biden's foreign relations credentials, signal that the US is back and shore up the US's influence in transatlantic relations, after a dismal four years under Trump.But even amid all that puffery, US allies are wary of isolating China, with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the G7 expressing a desire to frame this as a 'green BRI' granting access to financing for low-carbon projects like clean energy that 'shows who we are, not who we are against'. Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson gestures, during a press conference on the final day of the G7 summit in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, England, Sunday June 13, 2021. (Ben Stansall/Pool Photo via AP) ​​​​​​​While planning to offer a US$100 billion a year in alterative loans, the G7 has collectively signalled it is more keen on a path forward less seen as a challenge of China and more a framework in which G7 nations can still engage with China.Even within the US, some politicians rather call this the 'Green Marshall Plan', to avoid demonising the BRI.THE DRAWBACKS OF THE B3WPerhaps the better question is whether the B3W can credibly rival the BRI. The answer is less certain. The B3W after all is playing catch-up. Being a nascent idea, the B3W naturally lacks a clear pathway forward that helps developing countries access global trade and build their respective economies.  In comparison, the eight-year-old BRI has an integrated, regional infrastructure development plan based on supply chain considerations connecting markets via integrated port-rail-road transport networks.READ: Commentary: Just how much do China's Belt and Road projects benefit recipient countries?READ: Commentary: We sure believe some weird stuff about China's Belt and Road InitiativeNot only has the BRI created employment in local markets in the construction phase, it has also facilitated commercial sustainability by enhancing access to export markets.Another advantage that the BRI has is the Digital Silk Road that overlays the BRI, digitally connecting even the most remote of markets, with BRI countries obliged to use the digital network and standards of China when doing trade. But the B3W does not impose this level of integration.The challenge also is how the B3W will treat projects with significant carbon footprints commonplace in developing countries.Under the B3W investment criteria, there would be no funding given to coal-fired power stations but developing countries might have few credible energy alternatives. Meanwhile, under China's BRI green investment guidelines, funding would be given to high-efficiency low-emissions coal power stations.READ: Commentary: China's foreign loans, as a recent study shows, is full of ‘Chinese characteristics'It also remains unclear whether the B3W private sector funding model, funded by patient capital including pension funds, insurance companies and other private investors, will be able to catalyse development on the scale of the BRI, which uses China's vast foreign exchange reserves and financing from state banks to back projects.For now, it is difficult to see how the B3W can rival the cooperation agreements with 140 countries and 31 international organisations enjoyed by China's BRI.TIMING IS EVERYTHINGThen again, COVID-19 has exposed a number of shortcomings of the BRI, particularly with 20 per cent of BRI projects being put on hold. China is advancing plans to build the new carbon-belching power stations abroad as part of its trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative. (Photo: AFP/Rizwan TABASSUM) These project delays have highlighted the fundamental problem afflicting many BRI projects of a lack of upfront due diligence with the result being that many BRI projects have often simply traded speed early in the project cycle for far more difficult problems later.Tied financing that favour the use of Chinese contractors and opaque practices have also been associated with cost blow-outs and corruption scandals, most infamously in the case of the East Coast Rail Link project in Malaysia.And with several countries now challenging China's claims that BRI had been built on mutual respect, strong people-to-people bonds and non-interference in national sovereignty, there is a window of opportunity for the B3W to make itself more relevant.Andre Wheeler is chief executive of Asia Pacific Connex and has 20 years of international business experience in the US and Asia-Pacific.;channelnewsasia.com;1591;news;SG;en;[];https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/15011042/16x9/991/557/d2ede0f290efa0896c46b6aa37a7d8a1/Fv/china-has-slammed-g7-leaders-after-they-criticized-beijing-s-human-rights-record-in-xinjiang-and-hong-kong-1623647462549-2.jpg;False;Andre Wheeler;19.076946;b2b5398fa60f4986fa022a759b4cca08;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

Up north, the Bangkok-Nong Khai high-speed railway, which links the Thai capital to the Lao border at Nong Khai, is expected to be operational by 2028. One by one, these pieces are falling into place to potentially form a land corridor. When connected with ports and flanked by infrastructure projects, they will form a massive puzzle known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). First proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 - just a year after he rose to the country's top post - the BRI comprises an overland trade route spanning China, Central Asia and Europe, as well as a seafaring corridor through Southeast Asia to the Middle East and Africa.  Subsequently, 147 countries signed cooperation memorandums of understanding with China on the ambitious plan. According to financial data company Refiniti, there were 3,220 BRI projects with a combined value of US$3.49 trillion in 2021.  While the BRI has significant strategic implications for China's growth and global influence, there have been controversies and economic challenges for the countries involved.  
 
 The initiative reminiscent of the ancient Silk Road was also unexpectedly grounded by the coronavirus pandemic.  A Chinese Foreign Ministry official was quoted as saying by Reuters in mid-2020 that about 20 per cent of the projects were 'seriously affected' and another 30 to 40 per cent were 'somewhat affected'. Fast forward to 2022, pandemic-battered countries around the world are opening up once more but China has remained locked within its borders, which caused its economic growth to slow to 0.4 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter and shrink by 2.6 per cent from the previous quarter. As China faces pressure to reach the growth target of 5.5 per cent this year, what will likely become of the BRI now and beyond?

 The narrative surrounding the BRI says it is an instrument for peaceful co-existence and mutual benefit, matching China's financial and industrial strengths with the participating countries' development needs. Riding on the rise of China from a poverty-stricken country to the world's second-biggest economy, the initiative symbolises a strong China shaping a new world order.  In Mr Xi's words, China had reached a new starting point in its development endeavours and was ready to steer a new normal of economic development.  'We will actively promote supply-side structural reform to achieve sustainable development, inject strong impetus into the Belt and Road Initiative and create new opportunities for global development,' he said at the opening ceremony of the Belt and Road Forum in May 2017. In his vision, the BRI is a 'road of prosperity' supported by industrial cooperation, financial systems and infrastructure connectivity.  The enormous scale of the BRI is a reflection of Mr Xi's confidence and ambition in claiming global pre-eminence, and this still holds true a decade later.   'I think Xi Jinping, like any other world leader, would want to create his own legacy,' said Dr Nur Shahadah Jamil, senior lecturer at Universiti Malaya's Institute of China Studies.

 'Being labelled as China's ‘strongman' after Mao Zedong, Xi has proven himself as a different kind of Chinese leader.  'Through his constant consolidation of power within the party and the country's political system, he has showcased his ambition and growing confidence by pursuing the BRI at the world stage - which none of his predecessors or other countries have embarked on,' she said.  For China, the BRI marked a departure from Deng Xiaoping's 'taoguang yanghui (keeping a low-profile)' strategy to 'yousuo zuowei (accomplish something)' strategy, Dr Nur Shahadah said. 'Thus, one may notice that Xi's style is more proactive and confident,' she said.  However, there has been scepticism about Beijing's motives.  'Why is China so nice to us?' is a common question posed to the Chinese hosts during academic exchanges, shared Professor Cheng Ming Yu, chairperson of the Belt and Road Strategic Research Centre at Malaysia's Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR).  And China's reply is simply, 'For win-win development.'     '‘Only when you grow, then we can grow. We have to grow together,'' Prof Cheng said.  'China cannot prosper if people cannot buy what they produce. It's better to make other countries develop at the same time, then China can transfer its technology and continue to sell its products.'  CONTROVERSIES AND CRITICISMS With an emphasis on infrastructure connectivity and unimpeded trade, the BRI has the potential to substantially improve trade, foreign investment and living conditions for people in participating countries, a World Bank study in 2019 suggested.  With the infrastructures in place, travel times could reduce by up to 12 per cent along the economic corridors, while that with the rest of the world was estimated to decrease by an average of 3 per cent.  Trade would also increase between 2.8 and 9.7 per cent for Belt and Road corridor economies and between 1.7 and 6.2 per cent for the world, the study added.  The caveat, though, was that China and the countries have to adopt policy reforms that increase transparency, expand trade, improve debt sustainability as well as mitigate environmental, social and corruption risks.  According to the report, one-quarter of the Belt and Road economies already have high debt levels, and medium-term vulnerabilities could increase for a handful of them.  China critics have long described the initiative as a debt trap that drowns countries in unsustainable debt as Beijing wields undue influence over them, not to mention sovereignty and security concerns.

 In Malaysia, the then Pakatan Harapan government suspended the ECRL and two Sabah gas pipeline projects in July 2018, citing national interests.  Then prime minister Mahathir Mohamad said in August 2018: 'The project will not go now, because we don't need them at the moment. Our priority is reducing our debts, if we are not careful, we could be bankrupt.'  The ECRL later resumed after the government negotiated with China to bring down the costs by RM21.5 billion to RM44 billion, while the gas pipeline projects were revived in February 2021 by the new government.  Elsewhere, countries like Pakistan, Myanmar, Maldives and Nepal were also reconsidering the terms of their BRI participation, Moody noted in a June 2019 report.  Beijing has rejected the debt trap claim. It is 'a lie made up by the United States and other Western countries', said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin in an August press conference.  One should not simply put the blame on one party for unsustainable or failed projects, said UTAR's Prof Cheng.  'It's very much a governance issue and cannot be blamed totally on the BRI,' she said.  'In business projects, there are investors and there are hosting countries. It depends on how you negotiate and how you carry out the projects.' She opined that BRI has been used as a political weapon, which resulted in other aspects being sidelined. Focus should be on the impact and how to benefit from the initiative's connectivity essence, she added.  
 
 It has been almost a decade since the BRI was conceptualised, and Prof Cheng is of the view that the first phase of the BRI - with a focus on mega projects laying down the infrastructures - is almost coming to its end.  The next phase is about building soft infrastructure.   'Focus may not be so much on spending money like before, not on the type of projects and scale,' she said. 'It will branch out to other aspects - such as the health, green and digital silk roads - different aspects of development using the same BRI concept.' A report published in 2022 by data analytics provider Refinitiv noted that the BRI was going through a recalibration process.  With COVID-19, China has spent much of the last two years helping its BRI partners, offering Chinese vaccines, personal protective equipment and health equipment to African, South Asian as well as South American countries. It is also working on joint vaccine production with nearly 20 partner countries and providing vaccine financing via the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, it said.  While there has been a steady development of BRI projects since the pandemic, engagement will be lower for the second half of 2022 and in the near future, said the deputy research director at Malaysia's Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs (IDEAS) Sri Murniati Yusof.  She was referencing a report from the Green Finance & Development Center at Fudan University's Fanhai International School of Finance, which indicated that the slower pace came after the decision by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce to stop fast overseas expansion.  'I also want to add that slower expansion may also be influenced by the domestic economic situation in China and slightly stricter requirements by the Chinese government for Chinese overseas investors.  'Since the end of 2021, the Chinese government has put more efforts into integrating sustainable development, particularly environmental sustainability in BRI projects through its BRI Green Development Coalition,' she said.  In September last year, Mr Xi announced at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) that Beijing will not finance new coal-fired power projects abroad.  Two months later, the Communist Party's central committee pledged to place greater importance on making BRI cooperation greener and more sustainable, according to Xinhua.  WHAT'S NEXT FOR THE BELT AND ROAD Hailing 'tangible and substantial progress' in cooperation between China and participating countries, Mr Wang, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said in August: 'Going forward, China will continue to make new and solid progress in high-quality Belt and Road cooperation with all parties.'  What can the world expect from Mr Xi on advancing his pet project, as he looks set to secure a fresh term in office during the Communist Party congress this month?

 A rebranding of BRI is on the cards, noted Dr Nur Shahadah of the Institute of China Studies as she drew attention to the Global Development Initiative proposed by Mr Xi at UNGA last year.  'According to Xi, the focus will be set on ‘people-centred development' by concentrating on helping poor nations recover in the post-pandemic era through international development cooperation.  'I think this initiative is a rebranding or repackaging of BRI, but it covers wider aspects and scope, including the field of digital economy or green economy,' she said.  BRI's importance in China's global strategy will stay and its global reach will likely expand gradually, said Min Ye, an associate professor of international relations at the Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies at Boston University.  That being said, BRI faces three significant hurdles, she told CNA.  The first hurdle is concerted competition from advanced democracies in infrastructure, financing and diplomacy. And the second is intractable recession induced by the pandemic in many countries.  'Third, China's domestic economy is facing a headwind, and Chinese companies and investors will be less capable and interested in global expansion,' she said.

38;Commentary: The rise and further rise of Bitcoin;;2021-01-08 22:00:51;full;https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/bitcoin-stock-price-2020-2021-outlook-exchange-13919858;channelnewsasia.com;Wherever the price goes from here, the fortunes of the leading cryptocurrency are clearly going to be one of the world's biggest financial stories ...;READING, England: Bitcoin achieved a remarkable rise in 2020 in spite of many things that would normally make investors wary, including US-China tensions, Brexit and, of course, an international pandemic.From a year-low on the daily charts of US$4,748 (£3,490) in the middle of March as pandemic fears took hold, bitcoin rose to just below US$30,000 by the end of the year. Since then it has climbed to all-time highs above US$38,000, making headlines day after day and driving up the prices of other cryptocurrencies at the same time. .So what has driven this huge price appreciation and is it different to the bubble of 2017?One reason for the massive price rise is that there has been a big influx of investors from large-scale institutions such as pension schemes, university endowment funds and investment trusts.This was not the case during the last bull market in 2017, in which the bitcoin price rose about 20-fold to almost US$20,000, only to slide back to the low US$3,000s a year later. In 2017, the cryptocurrency ecosystem was dominated by individual retail investors, many of whom were attracted to bitcoin's scarcity and the fact that it stood outside the global financial system.The 2017 bull market had all the signs of a classic financial bubble and investors who were buying in 'fear of missing out' (FOMO).THE MOVE MAINSTREAMThis time, big names such as billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones and insurance giant MassMutual have invested heavily, while even former naysayers like JP Morgan now say that bitcoin could have a bright future.  This all helps to increase trust in the cryptocurrency and indicates that it is becoming more mainstream. A representation of virtual currency bitcoin is seen in front of a stock graph in this illustration taken Nov 19, 2020. (Photo: REUTERS/Dado Ruvic) Bitcoin has also been backed by a few large consumer-facing payment names. PayPal now allows customers to buy, hold and sell bitcoin directly from their PayPal accounts.Rival digital payment firm Square reported in November that more of its Cash App users are buying the digital currency, and buying more on average than before.The number of vendors accepting bitcoin as a form of payment is growing rapidly.Possibly most importantly, Visa has been warming to bitcoin. In October it announced a handful of bitcoin-related credit and debit cards with leading crypto exchange Coinbase.With more and more ways of using bitcoin, it should mean that more people will want to hold it.Bitcoin has also become much more mature since the days when it was used mainly as a method to purchase drugs on the dark web on Silk Road. Bitcoin digital wallets, keys and exchanges are easier to access and there is a lot more reliable information out there than before.READ: Commentary: US dollar could face turning point soonREAD: Commentary: Cryptocurrency land has become an unregulated casinoThe introduction of financial products such as bitcoin futures and options, as well as blockchain-related funds, has allowed investors who might otherwise have been fearful of volatility to get involved.Bitcoin futures mean that investors can speculate on falling prices by 'going short' on the cryptocurrency.Nobel laureate Robert Shiller has suggested that the 2017 bubble could have been linked to the fact that there were no bitcoin futures at the time.THE INFLATION HEDGEBesides all this mainstream enthusiasm, the carnage brought by COVID-19 has led to huge stimulus packages from governments around the globe and many central banks printing more money. Representations of virtual currency Bitcoin are seen in this picture illustration taken on Mar 13, 2020. (File photo: REUTERS/Dado Ruvic) This could drive up inflation, which in turn lowers people's purchasing power. Indeed the US Federal Reserve last year signalled it would be slightly more tolerant of rising prices when it relaxed its 2 per cent inflation target.In the face of this threat, investments like bitcoin are being consider a store of value. The maximum number of bitcoin that will ever exist is set at 21 million (unless the protocol changes), and there are already about 18.5 million in circulation.The supply of new coins is also slowing down because the reward that bitcoin miners receive for verifying transactions on the blockchain halves roughly every four years – it fell from BTC12.5 to BTC6.25 last May. This scarcity is comparable to that of precious metals.READ: Commentary: Blockchain has been a lie all this whileREAD: Commentary: Lessons from Estonia, the world's most digitally advanced nationEven central banks are embracing cryptocurrencies. Russia, China, Canada, the EU and many others are either already working on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) for their countries or publishing white papers detailing their intentions to do so.This is an obvious sign that the powers that be in the old financial world are seeing cryptocurrencies as the future. Meanwhile, the US federal regulator has announced that retail banks can carry out payments with stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to traditional currencies.WHERE NEXTIt therefore seems that the recent bitcoin price appreciation may have more substance than in 2017. But not everyone agrees.Chief economist and strategist at Rosenberg Research and Associates, David Rosenberg, believes bitcoin is in a bubble and investors don't understand how it works.Rosenberg is well placed to comment on bubbles since he is known for identifying the US housing market bubble that led to the global financial crisis of 2008-2009.He believes investors don't understand how bitcoin works and it is in a classic, follow-the-herd bubble (though he has since conceded he is no expert on the cryptocurrency himself). Meanwhile, large volatility in the price is still a major issue, which will still worry some institutional investors.So what to believe? There are plenty of very bullish forecasts for the bitcoin price in 2021. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the founders of leading crypto exchange Gemini, believe bitcoin will eventually hit US$500,000 per coin, while a Citigroup analyst suggests a price of US$318,000 by December 2021.Obviously these parties have 'skin in the game' and these numbers may be too optimistic. However, in March 2020 the prospect of bitcoin reaching US$30,000 seemed impossible.Wherever the price goes from here, the fortunes of the leading cryptocurrency are clearly going to be one of the world's biggest financial stories in the year ahead.Andrew Urquhart is Associate Professor of Finance, ICMA Centre, Henley Business School, University of Reading.

Mr Heng was giving a keynote speech at the FutureChina Global Forum, themed A Resilient Future: Post-Pandemic Transformation & Opportunities in China and ASEAN.COVID-19 has inflicted a severe supply and demand shock to economies in China and Southeast Asia, Mr Heng said, noting that businesses and workers are facing a challenging time.Nevertheless, Mr Heng said Asia is well-positioned to contribute to global economic growth, and detailed how China and ASEAN can work together to make Asia a ""vibrant region"" for businesses, jobs and good standards of living.READ: Singapore remains open to global talent; aim is to benefit, not substitute Singaporeans: Chan Chun Sing Mr Heng said countries must remain open and connected to the world, and make adjustments so that globalisation works for all, while Singapore must strengthen its connectivity with the region.In an era of ""tremendous change"", businesses must also create partnerships to emerge stronger from the crisis, he added.MAKING GLOBALISATION WORK FOR ALLIn an uncertain economic environment, Mr Heng acknowledged that workers are anxious about their jobs and the benefits of economic openness.However, he urged countries to restructure their economies and upskill their workers to ensure globalisation remains beneficial to all, adding that an open and connected global economy allows countries to develop and prosper.Mr Heng pointed out that global trading rules set up after the Second World War have led to world exports increasing by more than 300 times prior to COVID-19, with countries in the region ""benefitting immensely"".READ: Job competition from work pass holders could become a 'divisive issue', will be addressed, says President Halimah""In Singapore, we are adjusting our policies to ensure that they continue to serve the interests of our people,"" he said.""We are reviewing our work pass policies, strengthening fair consideration, enhancing efforts to upskill our workers and strengthening our social safety nets for those affected by economic disruption.""But we must not undermine what has made us successful, by closing ourselves off from the world.""READ: Minimum qualifying salary to rise by S$600 for Employment Passes and S$100 for S Passes, higher requirement for financial servicesThe Ministry of Manpower announced last month that it will raise the minimum qualifying salary for new Employment Pass and S Pass applicants to continue to encourage fair hiring, particularly in the current economic climate.Southeast Asia will also be an increasingly important part of China's reliance on the international market for goods and services, Mr Heng said, noting that the 10 Southeast Asian economies have become China's top trading partner for the first time this year.READ: Adjustments to Employment Pass and S Pass criteria 'timely' to help businesses retain local employment: Josephine Teo""With the restructuring of global supply chains, post-COVID-19, Southeast Asia can be an attractive choice for companies considering a ‘China Plus One' strategy,"" he said.""Besides manufacturing, the digital economy and infrastructure development also offer ample opportunities in Southeast Asia.""STRENGTHENING REGIONAL CONNECTIVITYAmid the pandemic, Mr Heng said Singapore must strengthen connectivity with the region and the world to facilitate the movement of goods, data and people.On the movement of goods, Mr Heng said Singapore must work closely with like-minded partners to keep its trade lines and supply chains open, adding that ASEAN and China are committed to mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on trade and investment. ""With China, we are pressing ahead with the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor of the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative,"" he said.""We saw a 20 per cent increase in trade volume in the first half of this year, despite COVID-19, through this corridor.""READ: Business and official travellers on Singapore-China 'fast lane' arrangement must get COVID-19 swab testsOn the movement of people, Mr Heng said Singapore is re-opening its borders gradually and carefully, with its first Fast Lane launched with China in June for essential business and official travel.Singapore has since agreed on similar arrangements with Malaysia, Brunei, South Korea and Japan, and relaxed border controls for visitors from Brunei and New Zealand for general travel.READ: Safe Travel Office set up under ICA for 'easier and smoother' traveller experience as borders gradually reopen""We are also in discussion with other parties to expand travel arrangements,"" Mr Heng said.

40;Feature: Macclesfield, England keeps its ancient silk-making heritage alive;Hui Xiaoshuang;2022-08-16 19:08:00;full;https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2022/08/17/feature-macclesfield-england-keeps-its-ancient-silk-making-heritage-alive;thestar.com.my;"MACCLESFIELD, Britain, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- The town of Macclesfield in northwest England was dubbed the ""silk capital of England"" in the 18th century, and now local entrepreneurs and artists are…";"MACCLESFIELD, Britain, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- The town of Macclesfield in northwest England was dubbed the ""silk capital of England"" in the 18th century, and now local entrepreneurs and artists are trying to keep this heritage alive. A glimpse at the names of Macclesfield's many buildings, streets and restaurants, such as ""Silk Retail Park,"" ""Silk Road,"" ""Silk House,"" and ""Silktown Fryer,"" reveals the significant role silk has played in the town's history and identity. According to Macclesfield's historical records, the town started to boom in the 18th and 19th centuries thanks to its lucrative silk-manufacturing industry. It is said to have been the world's largest producer of finished silks. The town's location at the western end of the ancient Silk Road, a network of trade routes connecting Europe and China, also contributed to its silk trade boom. Jeff Coghlan, a local artist who runs a creative company, said Macclesfield's heritage is ""built on the pillars of silk,"" and his company is trying to ""use some of that heritage to create new things."" Coghlan's company aims to lend modern touches to Macclesfield's silk-making tradition, such as designing Christmas cards based on old silk patterns. The company also wants to tap into the potential for cooperation between the British and Chinese silk industries. China has a strong production capacity, he said, while British strength lies in high-end silk products. ""A lot of Chinese tourists are coming to discover the silk heritage that we've got as an old English town. We need to build those bridges between our nations and celebrate those things,"" he said. Such cooperation goes back to the days when many silk factories in Macclesfield imported large quantities of silk fabrics from China. Coghlan is not alone in striving to keep Macclesfield's silk-making heritage alive. Although the town now has a relatively small silk industry, a number of local enterprises are keen on injecting it with new vitality. Adamley Textiles, one of Britain's leading silk printers, has been working to combine traditional screen printing and modern digital printing techniques to produce luxury fabrics. Tro Manoukian, Adamley's chief executive officer, told Xinhua that it is important to carry on Macclesfield's heritage. His company has ""exceptionally strong"" business ties with China, he emphasized, adding that Adamley imports most of its silk fabrics from east China's Zhejiang Province. ""They manufacture the best quality silk in the world... (It's a) fantastic partnership,"" he said. He expects the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative to benefit both Britain and China as well as all other countries along the route.";thestar.com.my;1823;news;MY;en;Hui Xiaoshuang;https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/newTsol_logo_socmedia.png;False;;27.732124;20dc86747481eec61a45eecc5b46c72f;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}
41;BRI strengthens Malaysia and China's economic cooperation;Search Scholar Series;2022-09-27 00:49:00;full;https://www.thestar.com.my/opinion/columnists/search-scholar-series/2022/09/27/bri-strengthens-malaysia-and-chinas-economic-cooperation;thestar.com.my;MALAYSIA and China have evolved through many remarkable economic achievements through their relationship, which started in the 1970s and has existed for more than 47 years.;"MALAYSIA and China have evolved through many remarkable economic achievements through their relationship, which started in the 1970s and has existed for more than 47 years. This relationship can be traced back to the political and economic collaboration between the emperors of the Ming dynasty and the Malacca Sultanate. Nowadays, China has been Malaysia's largest trade partner for 13 consecutive years and has become the primary export market of Malaysia. Meanwhile, Malaysia is China's second-largest trade partner in Southeast Asia. Malaysia and China also have collaborated on the health facilities and assistance, especially for the Covid-19 vaccine during the Covid-19 pandemic. This relationship is further strengthened by Malaysia's involvement in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). This initiative further contributes to Malaysia's economic development, especially with the development of the Malaysia-China Kuantan Industrial Park (MCKIP), East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) and Kuantan Port Expansion Project. These projects form part of the Celt and Road Initiative (BRI) and are expected to boost and advance the connectivity and network between the east and west coast peninsular Malaysia states. The BRI has indirectly revived the ancient Silk Road, which existed during the Han dynasty in 130 BCE which connected land and sea trade networks between Europe, East Asia, and North Africa. The Silk Road, also known as the Silk Route, traced its name from the valuable and luxury Chinese silk; it played a vital role in history where its function was more than just a trade and exchange channel. During its golden age, the Silk Road did not only connect East and West, but it also facilitated the exchange of arts, culture, religion, ideas, technologies, and innovations. This historical Silk Road is considered revolutionary, especially as the first international trade route before its fall during the Ming dynasty. It has paved the way for modern-day international trade. For that reason, BRI is also called the New Silk Road, as it resembles the ancient Silk Road. The BRI project was launched in 2013 by President Xi Jinping with the primary goal of development and investment initiatives that covers Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. The main agenda of BRI is to strengthen China's connectivity with the world. Therefore, the main focus of this project is on the transportation infrastructure across the countries and regions involved, which indirectly reminisces the role ancient Silk Road in the past. The construction of the infrastructures, including seaports, airports, bridges, highways, railways and industrial parks along the route, would foster productivity and economic growth. As a result, the BRI improves the economic integration and expansion between China as a host country and member countries. In addition, this initiative is expected to boost political cooperation and communication in various aspects, including micro and macroeconomic policies, as well as cultural ties of the BRI countries. The BRI involves participation from more than sixty countries. Despite many critiques, China is very committed to developing a sustainable BRI that would further spur economic and trade cooperation, especially between east Asia and Western countries that seemed neglected before this. The BRI embraces sustainable growth development by committing to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, creating a carbon-neutral economy policy and facilitating green financing. The BRI would also foster growth in the digital economy, especially in financial technology, e-commerce and mobile payment that has already taken control of the market. Both Malaysian and China governments have also facilitated many initiatives to foster the development of the digital economy that has shown tremendous growth, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic. The digital economy provides room for the existing business to expand into online platforms and digital-based business and entrepreneurship activities to bloom in the market. Thus, the BRI will further enhance opportunities for countries involved to participate and compete in the global market. The cooperation between China and Malaysia through the BRI would further strengthen the shared interest in many sectors. In the tourism sector, Chinese tourists are the third biggest group of tourists that come to Malaysia. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, 3.1 million China tourists visited Malaysia, and this number is expected to rise, especially after the endemic phase. Moreover, this trend is expected to increase further, especially after the completion of the ECRL. This project facilitates connectivity between the East Coast Economic Region (ECER), which is forecasted to be completed in 2030. It will further boost ecotourism destinations and products on the east coast that are rich with natural attractions. Therefore, to tap this huge potential, new transnational tourism opportunities and initiatives will be created by the public and private sectors in light of the collaboration between China as a host country and BRI countries. Despite the undeniably significant benefits that will be reaped by countries involved in the BRI, many issues must be tackled appropriately by the host and BRI countries involved. The different government systems, political stability, economic policy, and diversified culture of the countries remain a challenge in implementing a smooth BRI. It is very crucial for the China and the BRI countries to maintain a stable relationship to ensure a successful BRI.

'China and Malaysia should take more effort in implementing the high-level agreements and reinforce the top-level design in our digital cooperation,' said China's Ambassador to Malaysia Ouyang Yujing. 'The two sides should promote digital economy cooperation in the context of the Belt and Road Initiative and the Digital Silk Road to achieve optimum results,' he said in his speech at the Malaysia-China Digital Economy Forum 2022 here yesterday. He said this includes the sharing of experiences in the relevant digital sectors while speeding up the process of implementing the MOU on digital telecommunications cooperation. 'We need to further strengthen the digital free trade zone located in Malaysia and expand its influence to the whole of Asean and make it an exemplary model of the Digital Silk Road in the region,' he added. Ouyang lauded Malaysia's digitalisation level as among the highest in the South-East Asian region. 'Malaysia's Internet economy amounted to over RM97.6bil in 2021. 'Based on statistics, Malaysia's digital economy accounted for 22.6% of its 2020 GDP (gross domestic product) output. 'It is expected to reach 25.5% in 2025,' he said. He added that Malaysia's ecommerce transaction volume reached a new high of RM1 trillion last year. Ouyang said some Chinese companies have been cooperating well with their counterparts here by helping to develop local ecommerce, online payment and cross-border logistics platforms. In his speech when launching the forum, Deputy Higher Education Minister Datuk Dr Ahmad Masrizal Muhammad said the nation has undergone rapid transformation as a result of the booming digital economy. 'Ordering our favourite nasi lemak and teh tarik using a mobile app and making payment using an ewallet has become part and parcel of our life,' he said. He urged the government and the private sector to further collaborate with their Chinese counterparts in developing the digital economy. 'I call for greater investment on education, with a focus on giving everyone equal access to the learning of digitalisation skillsets to embrace the digital economy,' he added. The Prime Minister's special envoy to China, Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing, who delivered a recorded message, said the digital economy is no longer fiction of the future but a reality in people's daily lives. As such, Tiong, who is also chairman of the Malaysia-China Business Council, urged local industry players to forge closer cooperation with China in advancing the nation's digital economy.;thestar.com.my;1823;economics;MY;en;MARTIN CARVALHO;https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2022/09/30/1757195.jpg;False;;26.008196;7c87b67b02b1181f996a214917990b0c;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

CHINA is one of the fastest growing economies recovering from the global pandemic. As a major locomotive for the global and regional economy, China is also the biggest trading partner for many countries across the world, including the 10 Asean member countries. The republic's Belt and Road Initiative has driven infrastructure development in Asia, Africa and Central Asia, while its technological advancements and innovations are shaping the future of industries. So, how can China benefit the countries of South-East Asia and help accelerate their recovery following the Covid-19 pandemic? This will be one of the points of discussion at the upcoming 2021 World Chinese Economic and Technology Summit (2021 WCET). Entitled 'Promoting Business, Cultural & Digital Economy Cooperation and Diplomacy', the 2021 WCET is set to kick off on Dec 16 at Shangri-La Rasa Sayang, Penang. WCET started out as the World Chinese Economic Summit in 2009. It was founded by leading Malaysian entrepreneur Tan Sri Lee Kim Yew of the Cheng Ho Multicultural Trust and think tank leader Tan Sri Michael Yeoh. The summit is an annual international forum promoting business linkages, connectivity, shared prosperity, and sustainability. Its aim is to enhance connections between China and the world and among the global Chinese diaspora. With the rapid rise of technology and innovation, the summit was rebranded to cover the role of technology in business, education, healthcare and economic growth. Due to the pandemic, technology has emerged as a game changer while the digital economy has become a major driver of sustainable economic growth and transformation. However, the global growth in e-commerce and the acceleration of artificial intelligence, robotics and big data analysis have impacted countries and companies. WCET was started as the World Chinese Economic Summit in 2009 by co-founders think tank leader Tan Sri Michael Yeoh (pic) and leading Malaysian entrepreneur Tan Sri Lee Kim Yew. The evolution of WCET makes it a strategic platform for regional and global business collaborations to build back better following the pandemic. At the 2021 WCET summit, participants will discuss key trends in the digital economy as well as new challenges and opportunities. China's vast advances in digital, green, rail and construction technologies can provide opportunities for countries and companies including small and medium enterprises.

Under the guidance of the leadership from both sides, the two countries have witnessed good momentum in the development of bilateral ties with pragmatic cooperation in all sectorsLOGISTIC, FINANCIAL CONNECTIVITYThe New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor is a trade and logistics passage jointly built by western Chinese provincial regions and Singapore under the framework of the China-Singapore (Chongqing) Demonstration Initiative on Strategic Connectivity, or Chongqing Connectivity Initiative (CCI).The corridor serves as a bridge between the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, and helps enhance connectivity between Western China, Southeast Asia and the rest of the world.As part of the corridor, the land-sea freight route had linked 234 ports in 92 countries and regions as of June 30 this year, according to sources with the route's operation platform.The platform also showed that 386 trips were made along the route in the first half of 2020, while the route had seen a total of 1,966 trips from its official opening in September 2017 to June 30 this year.Goods transported along the route covered more than 350 categories including automobiles and auto parts, chemical raw materials and products, light industry and pharmaceutical products and fresh and frozen goods, according to the platform.In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, Singapore must strengthen connectivity with the region and the world to facilitate the movement of goods, data and people, said Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat in the FutureChina Global Forum last month.Singapore is pressing ahead with China with the corridor. ""We saw a 20 percent increase in trade volume in the first half of this year, despite COVID-19, through this corridor,"" Heng said at the forum.China has been Singapore's largest trading partner and Singapore has been China's largest foreign investor since 2013, said Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Saturday in an exchange of congratulatory message to commemorate the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries.Actually Singapore state-backed investor Temasek saw its holdings in China surpassed its home market of Singapore for the first time in the financial year ending on March 31. Its exposure to China rose to 29 percent of assets, compared with 24 percent for Singapore, according to the Temasek Review 2020 released last month.DIGITAL CONNECTIVITYAnother highlight of China-Singapore cooperation focuses on digital connectivity in a bid to boost the development of digital economy, which has become more pertinent than ever amidst the Covid-19 pandemic.The first Joint Implementation Committee meeting of the Singapore-China (Shenzhen) Smart City Initiative was held online in June, during which eight MOUs were signed.People wearing masks walk on the sidewalk at the shopping area in Singapore on June 12, 2020. - XinhuaAnalysts believe that the initiative would facilitate the digital collaboration between Southeast Asia and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area in south China, a region which China aims to develop into ""a role model of high-quality development.""In another development, Singapore and China's Chongqing co-hosted the Smart China Expo (SCE) Online in September. Singapore was a guest of honor for the previous two sessions of the expos in 2018 and 2019.In her speech at the SCE, Singapore's Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo noted that Singapore and Chongqing have a shared commitment to be at the forefront of digital connectivity, and digital connectivity is a key pillar of the CCI.She noted that COVID-19 has made ""going digital"" central to everyday interaction.""Digital connectivity has also enhanced physical trade and connectivity between our regions. We have worked together to make the clearance of goods more efficient"" by linking Singapore's Networked Trade Platform, a one-stop trade and logistics ecosystem which supports digitalization efforts, and China's single window platform, making the exchange of digital trade documents between the two countries seamless and reduce costs for businesses, said the minister.CULTURAL AND PEOPLE TO PEOPLE EXCHANGESDespite the challenges posed by the pandemic, China and Singapore are making concerted efforts in promoting cultural and people to people exchanges.Besides online meetings between officials of the two sides, a fast lane connecting six Chinese provinces and municipalities with Singapore was established in June in the first phase to facilitate essential business and official travel between the two countries amidst the Covid-19.Moreover, Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, visited Singapore in August, and met with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat and other senior officials.Heng said at the FutureChina Global Forum that Yang is his first foreign visitor since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.In a message published on the English daily the Straits Times on Thursday to mark the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between China and Singapore and the 71st founding anniversary of the People's Republic of China, Chinese ambassador to Singapore Hong Xiaoyong said that China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has been a major platform for bilateral cooperation.Under the BRI, the third-party cooperation is well underway, and the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor started to forge synergy with the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation, he said.On the cultural front, Singapore's Asian Civilization Museum (ACM) and the Shanghai Museum are jointly hosting an exhibition on shipwreck treasures from the prosperous Tang Dynasty (618 A.D.-907 A.D.), which is the first international collaborative exhibition after the Shanghai Museum reopened this year.Speaking at a seminar held by ACM in August as a prelude to the exhibition, Singapore's Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean said that the show is particularly significant as the collection is a tangible demonstration of the long-standing historical links between China, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, which continue to flourish today.Singapore supports China's Belt and Road Initiative as it sees the benefit of enhanced connectivity and development in the Silk Road Spirit of ""peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and mutual benefit, Teo added. - Xinhua";thestar.com.my;1823;news;MY;en;;https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/10/04/885314.jpeg;False;;25.136854;8c3793eb44fe5e07d9157ca54063b772;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

Established in 2018, it aims to provide intellectual support to the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. In the latest annual meeting of the Advisory Council of the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation was held on Dec 17, 2021, the report titled 'High-Quality Belt and Road Cooperation: Partnership on Connectivity' was released, focusing on findings and recommendations from the 2019 and 2020 meetings. The joint statement from the 2019 and 2020 meetings was released to reflect the consensus of all countries and organisations in continuing to promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. In the 2019 annual meeting, the Advisory Council members exchanged views on promoting high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and strengthening international partnerships on connectivity. In 2020, the members further discussed building various Silk Road projects, as well as creating a new development paradigm. By analysing the outcome and implications of the report, we can consider the present position of the BRI. Firstly, the report shows that BRI is open to further development and opportunities, especially in developing a health Silk Road, a green Silk Road, a digital Silk Road and a clean Silk Road. These have become the new priority of the Belt and Road cooperation. Moving towards green, open and clean cooperation, member states are to continually explore new cooperation platforms and approaches, and also to embark on new initiatives and new endeavours. For instance, China joined the other 28 countries in launching the Initiative for Belt and Road Partnership on Covid-19 Vaccine Cooperation and Green Development during the Asia and Pacific High-level Conference on Belt and Road Cooperation held in June 2021. In terms of global development, the report finds Belt and Road cooperation is progressing towards achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations General Assembly. One of the benefits of international cooperation brought about by BRI is that most BRI activities focus on investment and development in developing countries. Such cooperation is crucial in developing infrastructure, increasing job opportunities, and spurring technological innovation. According to the research study, BRI cooperation aims to improve livelihoods, especially for people in developing countries and countries with low levels of human development. Therefore, the cooperation will be able to close the infrastructure gap between developed and developing countries, and eventually facilitate cross-border trade and investment. Promoting and supporting social, economic, fiscal, financial and environmental sustainability has always been the priority of BRI cooperation. Likewise, the BRI aims to attain a good balance between social progress, economic growth, financial sustainability and environmental protection. BRI cooperation not only focuses on infrastructure programmes but is also actively involved in fighting against the pandemic. Although the Covid-19 pandemic has postponed many international cooperation projects, BRI cooperation has played a significant role in maintaining connectivity between the countries, stabilizing and boosting economic growth, safeguarding as well as improving people's living conditions and interests. The BRI member states have joined together to combat the pandemic and support social and economic recovery. The Advisory Council recommends greater global cooperation. Thus, it is important to accurately demonstrate the positive impact of BRI cooperation to effectively promote synergy between the BRI and regional development plans. The council members hope that under the current situation, all relevant parties will continue to synergize with the BRI in implementing high-quality infrastructure projects, encouraging and improving greater participation from new and various cooperation partners, advancing global partnership on connectivity, fostering an open world economy, and exploring more development and initiatives. Currently, one of the most critical projects in the BRI partnership is building a health Silk Road, with the main aim of strengthening and promoting cooperation on vaccines in order to respond effectively to the Covid-19 pandemic. China is doing everything it can to support the rest of the world, as seen through the number of vaccines delivered by China, which has surpassed 2 billion doses as of today. Further policy recommendations include promoting green transformation of BRI cooperation, deepening cooperation in the digital sector, tackling the debt issue effectively to create a clean Silk Road, and enhancing the cooperation of Belt and Road with various countries. The Advisory Council is confident that BRI has enhanced mutual trust and cooperation among countries, and it will continue to grow further and promote international economic cooperation, in order to build a community with a better future. The Advisory Council emphasizes feedback, and has provided accurate feedback on outcomes, developments and benefits of the BRI to economies and the community. This is to raise awareness of the purposes and objectives of the BRI. Besides enhancing global trade and economic growth, BRI cooperation also aims to promote a healthy and clean society to improve standards of living. The council members believe that Belt and Road cooperation can serve as an excellent platform for global trade and economic cooperation through various development strategies and initiatives, by facilitating social, economic and environmental development in a balanced and integrated manner. With high-quality cooperation, the BRI can continue to improve and expand on multiple dimensions. Khoo Zheng Ying is a lecturer at Tunku Abdul Rahman University College.

Since its founding in 2001, SCO, now with eight full members, four observer countries and multiple dialogue partners, has become not only a strong pillar of global peace and development, but also a major force for international equity and justice. As this year marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of the SCO Charter and the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty on Long-Term Good-Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation of the SCO Member States, global attention has been placed on the upcoming Samarkand Summit of the SCO, where leaders will discuss how to jointly address global challenges and promote security and development. Here's what's on the agenda for the SCO summit. New membership Last year, the SCO launched procedures to admit Iran as a full member state. Moreover, it has granted dialogue partner status to Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Qatar. The memorandum of understanding on Iran's accession to the SCO will be discussed at this year's summit. Belarus has also formally submitted an application for full membership. The SCO has grown into the world's largest and most populous regional institution, and it has endeavoured to explore new ground, both theoretically and with actual steps, with a view to build a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind. Shared future for mankind The SCO is expected to continuously uphold the ""Shanghai Spirit"", commit itself to building a closer SCO community with a shared future, and make greater contributions to lasting peace and the common development of the world. The summit will issue the Samarkand Declaration, which will be a comprehensive political declaration on the SCO's position on international politics, economy and a range of other aspects. The participants will also discuss climate change, and the security of supply chains, energy and food, which are factors having great influence on the well-being of all humankind. The SCO countries have been supporting the further improvement of global economic governance, agreeing to deepen cooperation in building an open world economy. They also underlined the importance of further developing cooperation in a wide range of fields including culture, healthcare, education, science and technology, tourism, environment protection, mass media and sports. Joint construction of Belt and Road Most SCO members, observers and dialogue partners are located along the ancient Silk Road, providing them the geographical advantage of participating in the Belt and Road Initiative. In addition, the spirits of the two cooperation frameworks are in line with each other. The practical cooperation among SCO member states will be further expanded to green development, digital economy and other areas in the future in line with the concepts of ""a green Silk Road"" and ""a digital Silk Road"". SCO member states have implemented the initiative since it was first introduced, expanding pragmatic cooperation, increasing the construction of infrastructure and aligning their countries own development plans with the initiative, which has led to growth in trade, smooth freight and logistics, more transport capacity, and a boost in cultural exchanges and tourism development. In 2021, the combined GDP of all SCO nations was $23.3 trillion, 13 times higher than when the organisation was founded, and China has been ramping up efforts to boost trade with other SCO members, seeing its total trade volumes with other members reach $343.1 billion, a 40 per cent rise from the previous year. SCO has also been promoting synergy between the Belt and Road cooperation and the development strategies of various countries and regional cooperation initiatives. In May 2015, China and Russia signed a joint declaration of the connection of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the Eurasian Economic Union. China and Kazakhstan have also found common goals by synergising the initiative and Kazakh's economic plan, known as ""Nurly Zhol"" (meaning ""bright path""). The BRI also accelerates cooperation between China and Uzbekistan, which offered the desired opportunity for Uzbekistan to improve its inter-connectivity with the outside world and play a greater role in wider regional development.";thestar.com.my;1823;news;MY;en;The Star Online;https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2022/09/15/1738828.jpeg;False;;24.671032;a093e66200d625e4b920dbabc0b7cc30;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}
48;China-Asean Digital Silk Road under construction: China Daily contributor;;2021-07-26 13:09:00;timezone unknown;https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2021/07/26/china-asean-digital-silk-road-under-construction-china-daily-contributor;thestar.com.my;The writer Zhai Kun says that a good digital governance framework is needed for both global and regional development.;"BEIJING (China Daily/ANN): Data is in a stage of rapid growth. According to Statista, an international data organisation, the amount of data generated worldwide reached 59 zettabytes (59 trillion gigabytes) in 2020 and may increase about 35 times by 2035. The economic value created by data is also booming. According to an International Data Corporation forecast in 2019, the global data market will feature three major players by 2025 - with the Chinese data market accounting for about 28 per cent of the pie; the United States about 17.5 per cent; and the Europe, Middle East and Africa region about 27.6 per cent. Platform-based multinational corporations are also growing rapidly and becoming monopolistic by controlling user data. At the end of 2019, there were about 74 leading digital platform businesses in the world, of which 35 were US companies and 30 Chinese. However, the US has obvious comparative advantages in terms of market value, with US digital platforms accounting for 74.1 per cent of the global total, while Chinese platforms account for 22.5 per cent. The rapid development of the data economy has given rise to new forms of geopolitical competition. Countries and businesses can analyse and predict macroeconomic and social trends in other countries based on massive data collection and collation. However, with data protectionism on the rise, countries are increasingly opting for data encapsulation, access restrictions, and regulatory policies. In April 2020, the US Agency for International Development released its first ever Digital Strategy, which seeks to build a US-led international digital ecosystem through digital aid, which adopts ""US values"" as the norm for digital foreign aid and attempts to build a US-centred international digital alliance. Some of the claims made in the strategy are confusing, such as ""helping partner countries achieve self-reliance"", which is in fact aimed at building an international digital alliance to maintain the interests of the US, based on US technological strength. On the back of its huge data market and advantages in data economy, the EU seeks to gain a greater say in the international digital rule-making and erect barriers to its data market by introducing the ""gatekeeping"" draft law, increasing its budget allocation for the digital sector, and beginning research into 6G standards, with an aim of laying the foundation for long-term development in the digital area. The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue tech network, which was launched in Canberra on Feb 9, may lead to new changes in the international digital landscape. Participants include the National Security College of Australian National University; the Centre for a New American Security, a US think tank; Japan's National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies and the Observer Research Foundation, an Indian think tank. With the establishment of the Quad tech network, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue is gradually expanding its focus from conventional security to digital, network and other non-conventional security fields, which will also help refine the US' Indo-Pacific strategy by including the digital sector. Digitally small and medium-sized countries have also signed digital economy agreements and digital currency agreements to build secondary digital alliances away from China, the US and the European Union. The signing of such agreements represents a new phase for global economic alliances. A network of digital economy agreements led by Singapore has been established. There are also constant calls for secondary digital partnerships. At present, the Asia-Pacific region has become a major arena for digital competition, with South-east Asia in the spotlight for major powers thanks to the huge potential of its digital economy, in which China plays a crucial role. For geopolitical reasons, South-east Asia is indispensable for the Indo-Pacific strategy of the US and the EU, as well as the formation of secondary digital partnerships and the development of the global digital economy, since it will become the fourth largest digital market in the world, behind China, the US and Europe. As global digital competition intensifies, a good digital governance framework is needed for both global and regional development, which is precisely the point of building the China-Asean Digital Silk Road. China is strengthening its digital economy cooperation with the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean), having established a ministerial dialogue mechanism for digital economy cooperation with Thailand, signed Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) on e-commerce cooperation with Vietnam and Cambodia respectively, and started negotiations on a bilateral memorandum of understanding on cross-border e-commerce cooperation with Malaysia. China is also actively involved in the construction of digital infrastructure in Asean countries, with the launch of Alibaba Cloud in Indonesia in 2018 and its expansion in 2020. Besides, Chinese businesses partner with local Asean companies mostly through equity investment and mergers and acquisitions. China was the largest source of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) for Asean tech startups from 2016 to the first half of 2019. One of the key factors for China-Asean digital economy cooperation is cross-border data cooperation, which may serve as the catalyst for their greater strategic synergy. It is advisable that China and South-east Asian countries negotiate digital trade agreements while China and Asean set up a regional data and digital technology collaboration mechanism to drive digital cooperation in the form of industry- and business-led Asean integration. In East Asia, China, together with Asean and Singapore, may design a regional digital currency package which includes the digital currencies of the Republic of Korea, Japan and Singapore for a China-Asean digital currency toolbox to facilitate flows of capital and data and build a new digital governance model in the region. In the future, multilateral diplomacy may also be leveraged via the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and China-EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment for a China-Asean-EU trilateral cooperation platform to shape a broader area for international cooperation on the digital economy and its governance. Countries such as Japan and the Republic of Korea may also be included in due course to further extend the East Asian cooperation model on the digital economy. * The writer is a professor of the School of International Relations and a researcher at the Centre for Digital Governance at Peking University.";thestar.com.my;1823;news;MY;en;[];https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2021/07/26/1233249.jpg;False;;23.11209;e55c367ad8e030e9bdacfd6e1ed3ce9c;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

All of this will contribute to more trade, more development and more improvement in people's livelihood,"" he stressed.Zeng Jingsong, vice president of the Bangkok-based Charoen Pokphand Group, also hailed the CAEXPO as a key platform that brings more and more opportunities for cooperation and communication, and allows various enterprises to establish partnership in the region.""Besides, I also believe that the platform facilitates exchanges among governments and enterprises on their understanding of each other's markets, business strategies and development policies,"" he added.The CAEXPO has brought a host of opportunities to Singaporean companies particularly in the fields of infrastructure, trade and logistics to tap into markets in southeast Asia, said Low Boon Tian, chairman of the SingCham Guangxi Management Committee.""As China's reform and opening-up keep deepening, I believe more and more Singaporean companies will increase investment in China, especially as the country's business environment has got improved a lot,"" he added.The annual CAEXPO, a concrete fruit of the China-Asean cooperation, has played a vital role in strengthening the China-ASEAN relationship, said Benjamas Tanvetyanont, consul general of Thailand in Nanning.""This year's expo is held both online and offline. I hope those online and offline events will help spur (regional) economic recovery. In particular, as this year's expo highlights digital economy, online exhibitions will also help enterprises in the region find more business opportunities,"" she noted.She also mentioned that the robust trade volume between China and Asean so far this year is a testament to the enormous growth potential between the two sides, especially in trade and investment.In the first 10 months of the year, China-Asean bilateral trade volume reached 3.79 trillion yuan (US$571.64 billion), accounting for 14.6 per cent of China's foreign trade, up 7 percent from the same period last year, according to the General Administration of Customs.Ambassador Romana also praised this year's online expo as ""an example of how to conduct a trade expo amid the (COVID-19) pandemic,"" saying it shows China's confidence in being capable of containing the virus and proceeding with the trade expo to promote economic recovery at the same time.In this regard, Dino R. Kusnadi, minister of Indonesian embassy in China, spoke highly of the digital Silk Road, which he believes will be ""a solid base"" for mutually beneficial cooperation between China and ASean.Such a new mechanism is needed to boost the China-ASsean relations to be sustainable and grow further, he noted. - Xinhua";thestar.com.my;1823;news;MY;en;;https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/11/28/953842.jpg;False;;21.815828;b261aba6297b6d4f81652c3cb9459e7b;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}
50;Building strategic alliances in fintech development between China and Malaysia;Search Scholar Series;2021-11-15 08:01:00;timezone unknown;https://www.thestar.com.my/opinion/columnists/search-scholar-series/2021/11/15/building-strategic-alliances-in-fintech-development-between-china-and-malaysia;thestar.com.my;​​​​​​​ FINANCIAL technology (fintech) refers to the adoption of technology to improve and support the delivery of services in the finance sector. Although fintech encompasses multiple finance…;China is among the leading countries globally when it comes to the investment, development and adoption of new technologies, including fintech. In China, m-payment is the most popular payment method for conducting day-to-day transactions. M-payment is dominated by two major players, namely Ant Group (formerly known as Ant Financial Services Group) for Alipay and Tencent for WeChat Pay. Launched in 2004, Alipay serves as a third-party payment platform in China and is operated by Ant Group, an affiliate company of China's e-commerce giant Alibaba Group. Ant Group specialises in providing consumer finance services such as mobile wallets, real-time payments, peer-to-peer payments and digital currency solutions. Meanwhile, WeChat Pay was released in 2013 by Tencent, a well-diversified company in several business segments including fintech and business services, online advertising, online games and social networks. According to iResearch Consulting Group, both companies captured about 94% of China's third-party mobile payment ecosystem in the first quarter of 2020. These Chinese fintech giants entered Malaysia's m-payment space, pioneered by Ant Group, in early 2017. One of the primary motivations for Alipay's entry into Malaysian soil is to enable inbound tourists from China to spend while visiting the country. Besides, this internationalisation strategy is a vital element of the Digital Silk Road, which supports China's Belt and Road Initiative via fintech and digital technologies. Prior to this, Alibaba Group announced its plan to establish an e-commerce hub in Malaysia to stimulate the growth of e-commerce and trade in this region as part of the collaboration between Alibaba Group and the Malaysian government to develop a Digital Free Trade Zone (DFTZ) in the country. The DFTZ is the company's first electronic world trade platform to be established outside China, as an important step towards developing the Digital Silk Road. At the same time, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), being the regulator of payment services of Malaysia, has been very supportive of the growth of fintech services throughout the country. For instance, BNM has clearly established its target of migrating cash transactions towards electronic payment systems in its Financial Sector Blueprint 2011-2020. In addition, BNM launched the Financial Technology Enabler Group (FTEG) in June 2016 to formulate and enhance regulatory policies to facilitate the adoption of technological innovations in the Malaysian financial services industry. The FTEG maintains a regulatory sandbox, which allows both financial institutions and fintech companies to experiment their fintech solutions in a production or live environment, subject to certain safeguards and regulatory requirements. In order to be recognised as a lawful issuer of electronic money (e-money) in Malaysia, an issuer has to fulfil two main legal requirements. Firstly, it is required to set up a company incorporated in Malaysia under the Malaysian Companies Act. Secondly, it has to obtain approval from BNM. In compliance with the legal requirements, Ant Group established its subsidiary, Alipay Malaysia Sdn Bhd in 2017 and subsequently received its regulatee status. Ant Group's footsteps to secure an e-money licence from BNM were later followed by its major competitor, Tencent. Besides, these Chinese fintech companies have also established strategic alliances with Malaysian banks. For instance, Alipay Malaysia has developed strategic alliances with the three largest domestic banks, namely Maybank, CIMB and Public Bank. This collaboration focuses on several key areas such as ensuring the real-time retail payment platform is implemented effectively, strengthening risk management and security controls of m-payment providers against cybersecurity risks and instilling customer confidence in using m-payment. Meanwhile, Tencent has partnered with Hong Leong Bank to provide WeChat Pay payment solutions in Malaysia. Such collaboration is deemed as a win-win solution since it brings the two industries together to integrate their operations by leveraging on each other's resources, expertise and technologies. On the one hand, it enables the Chinese fintech companies to acquire local knowledge and access to the extensive merchant network of the domestic banks. This allows the Chinese fintech companies to implement their m-payment services with greater ease, which are widely accepted by local merchants nationwide. As of 2018, more than 18,000 merchants nationwide have accepted Alipay, while over 3,500 merchants had accepted WeChat Pay by early 2019. On the other hand, this venture enables the domestic banks to speed up the execution and adoption of m-payment technology while mitigating the risks associated with the development of internal m-payment technology. Additionally, the Chinese fintech companies have also entered into a series of strategic partnerships with other entities. For example, Alipay Malaysia has collaborated with 7-Eleven Malaysia, Starbucks, GHL Systems, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd and Touch 'n Go, while the major outlets that support WeChat Pay Malaysia include KK Super Mart, Starbucks, Tealive and Petron. In a nutshell, the entry of Chinese fintech companies into Malaysia has generated more awareness and acceptance of m-payment. Given the rising connectivity and proliferation of smart devices in the country, m-commerce is set to grow rapidly. The growth in digital adoption is further accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has encouraged greater reliance on fintech solutions. Nonetheless, issues related to the security and privacy of m-payment which act as major impediments to its adoption have to be addressed accordingly to alleviate fears and concerns among the consumers. Moreover, the m-payment space is becoming increasingly crowded and fragmented as more fintech players are jumping on the bandwagon, making it imperative for each player to rethink its business model in order to remain competitive and profitable in the long-run. Taken together, the promising developments in m-payment or fintech in Malaysia, including the participation of Chinese fintech companies, are drawing BNM's vision of building a cashless society one step closer to fruition.

As this year marks the 30th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations between China and Kazakhstan, Xi, who was making a state visit to the Central Asian nation, said the two countries have witnessed fruitful results in bilateral ties over the past years and taken the lead on a series of issues, from solving border issues to conducting international production capacity cooperation. China highly values developing its relations with Kazakhstan and firmly supports the reform measures it has taken to safeguard national stability and development, Xi said, adding that China will always be a friend and partner that Kazakhstan can trust and rely on. Noting that China-Kazakhstan cooperation enjoys a solid foundation, huge potential and broad prospects, the Chinese president urged that both sides make good use of existing mechanisms to deepen strategic alignment and leverage their complementary advantages to take bilateral cooperation to a higher level and a larger scale. He also called on the two countries to promote high-quality Belt and Road development, expand cooperation in such areas as trade, the economy and interconnectivity, and explore cooperation in new fields including big data, digital finance and green energy. In February, Tokayev travelled to Beijing to attend the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Winter Games and met with Xi. ""The strategic navigation offered by the two heads of states maps out blueprints and charts a course for the two sides in rolling out cooperation in various fields,"" Chinese Ambassador to Kazakhstan Zhang Xiao said in an article published in People's Daily on Wednesday. The booming pragmatic cooperation between the two countries could be illustrated by their bilateral trade in the first seven months of the year, which reached $17.7 billion, up 18.9 per cent year-on-year. With regard to production capacity, the two countries have identified 52 cooperative projects totaling $21.2 billion, covering sectors including mining, energy, industry, commerce, transportation and shipping. ""China's branded electronic devices, cellphones and automobiles are widely acclaimed in Kazakhstan, and Kazakhstan's high-quality, green agricultural products have won recognition from Chinese consumers. Economic complementarity and interdependence between the two countries are constantly rising,"" said Zhang, the ambassador. Yerlan Madiyev, a China expert at the World Economy and Politics Institute, a Kazakh think tank, said that China has long supported the construction and socioeconomic development of Central Asian countries, and has gained trust from countries in the region. ""China has always been one of the most important strategic partners of Kazakhstan in every field of bilateral cooperation,"" he said. China is Kazakhstan's fifth-largest source of foreign investment, and amid the ravaging Covid-19 pandemic, bilateral trade continues to grow at a rapid rate, he added. Bulat Sultanov, director of the Research Institute of International and Regional Cooperation at Kazakh-German University, said China-Kazakhstan strategic cooperation is ""of particular importance in the current situation"". Amid the current geopolitical changes in the world, China-Kazakhstan teamwork could focus on attracting more Chinese investment to Kazakhstan and boosting the synergy of the development visions pursued by the two countries, he added. The scholar highlighted promising areas for the two nations to work on, such as establishing a ""digital Silk Road"" based on digital technologies and boosting exports of Kazakhstan's agricultural products to China.

U.S. President Joe Biden will unveil the plans, flanked by other Group of Seven leaders, some of whom have already unveiled their own separate initiatives, at their annual gathering being held this year at Schloss Elmau in southern Germany. Increasingly worried about China, G7 leaders first floated plans for the project last year, and are formally launching it now under a fresh title, ""Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment"" while dropping the moniker ""Build Back Better World"" first coined by Biden during his presidential campaign. Biden will unveil several specific projects at a G7 side event, joined by leaders from Britain, Germany, Japan, the European Union and Canada, vowing to focus on projects that help tackle climate change as well as improve global health, gender equity and digital infrastructure. Notably absent will be French President Emmanual Macron who had formally joined the Chinese infrastructure program. ""The president's not thinking that we need to spend dollar for dollar versus China... though if you add up what the U.S. and the G7 partners are going to be announcing, it comes pretty close to the number,"" one senior U.S. official told reporters. The funds would be raised through grants and federal funds, and by leveraging private-sector investments, the White House said, adding that hundreds of billions of additional dollars could come from multilateral development banks, development finance institutions, sovereign wealth funds and others. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) scheme, which Chinese President Xi Jinping launched in 2013, involves development and investment initiatives in over 100 countries, with a range of projects including railways, ports and highways. White House officials say Xi's plan to create a modern version of the ancient Silk Road trade route has provided little tangible benefit for many developing countries, with top jobs going to Chinese workers, while increasing rates of forced and child labor. Biden will highlight several flagship projects, including a $2 billion solar development project in Angola with support from the Commerce Department, the U.S. Export-Import Bank, U.S. firm AfricaGlobal Schaffer, and U.S. project developer Sun Africa. Together with G7 members and the EU, Washington will also provide $3.3 million in technical assistance to Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal as it develops an industrial-scale flexible multi-vaccine manufacturing facility in that country that can eventually produce COVID-19 and other vaccines.

BEIJING: Malaysia has clinched one of its biggest-ever raft of business deals – RM170bil worth of projects with China – that is poised to provide a vital boost to the economy.
 
Describing the achievement as 'historic', Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said this would further inject economic fervour into an already vibrant partnership with China.
 
'We are very optimistic ... Things are on an upward trend and I expect that we will break this record too,' the Prime Minister said at the close of the Malaysia-China Business Forum here yesterday.
 
The trade and investment commitments are higher than the RM144bil signed with China and RM158.68bil with India six years ago.
 
A total of 19 MOUs were inked with China during the forum, which was jointly organised by the International Trade and Industry Ministry (Miti) and Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia (ACCCIM).
 
Of the total investments, RM100bil was secured at Anwar's separate session with about 50 Chinese captains of industry, with the Prime Minister giving his every bit to pitch Malaysia's advantages.
 
Among the highlights is a RM32bil Automotive High-Technology Valley in Tanjung Malim that focuses on new energy vehicles.
 
This will be between Geely Holding Group and DRB-Hicom Bhd.
 
A 1,200MW multi-shaft combined-cycle power plant will also be developed in Gurun, Kedah, to further strengthen the power generation capacity in the peninsula via a joint-venture between THB Power Sdn Bhd, China National Machinery Import & Export Corp and Newfields Partners Sdn Bhd.
 
Anwar said Malaysia's position as a preferred investment destination had been strengthened further with the presence of renowned Chinese companies such as Risen Energy, Huawei, Longi Solar, Bytedance, Jinko Solar, EVE Energy, Alliance Steel, Alibaba Group and Xiamen University.
 
'It is my hope that these companies, which have invested in strategic areas, will continue to expand their presence and work with local partners as well as the government to build new capabilities, develop key industries and create high-paying jobs for Malaysians,' he added.
 
The Prime Minister urged both business communities to face the challenges and transform adversity and crises into opportunities.
 
'When the winds of change blow, some build walls while others build windmills. Malaysia remains firmly resolute to go full steam ahead in our strategic cooperation agenda with China and all other partners around the world,' he added.
 
Anwar, who is here on his first visit as Prime Minister, said escalation of geopolitical and trade tensions had adversely affected global supply and international trade while the turmoil in the US and European banking systems was causing volatility in the financial markets.
 
Miti minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz said the record amount of projects agreed was proof of the commitment between both sides to remove all obstacles in the quest to move forward.
 
'There will be huge spill-over effects with more jobs created for Malaysians.
 
'There will be a focus on areas such as the green and digital technologies,' he added.
 
Later in the evening, Anwar was accorded a ceremonial welcome at the Great Hall of the People by Chinese Premier Li Qiang.
 
Both leaders witnessed the signing of three G-to-G agreements. These would pave the way for further economic and trade cooperation, strengthening linkages between priority sectors such as in high-level manufacturing, digital economy, entrepreneur development, as well as R&D in agriculture and primary industries.";thestar.com.my;1823;news;MY;en;PAUL GABRIEL,Paulnews Thestar.Com.My;https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2023/04/02/2004914.jpg;False;;19.398909;aa9f5b57b7c48f2603fc7b319c55f175;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}
54;China's economic rebound to benefit the world;Ho Wah Foon;2020-12-27 02:00:00;timezone unknown;https://www.thestar.com.my/news/focus/2020/12/27/chinas-economic-rebound-to-benefit-the-world;thestar.com.my;CHINA will provide business opportunities for the world as its economy rebounds strongly from Covid-19 crisis on the back of effective government policies and political commitment, according to…;"Bright start: Transport minister and MCA president, Datuk Seri Ir Dr Wee Ka Siong (centre, back row) flanked by co-founder and patron of WCES Tan Sri Lee Kim Yew on his right and WCES organising chairman Tan Sri Michael Yeoh on his left during the ribbon-cutting ceremony. CHINA will provide business opportunities for the world as its economy rebounds strongly from Covid-19 crisis on the back of effective government policies and political commitment, according to prominent speakers at the World Chinese Economic Summit (WCES). With surge in exports and investments, China will be the only major economy to post growth this year and its GDP is projected to grow at 2%, according to Zhang Xiaoqiang via zoom at the WCES hybrid conference held in Kuala Lumpur last Monday. Speaking in Mandarin, the executive vice chairman cum CEO of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges said: 'China's dual-circulation economic policy is meant to create win-win situation for China and the world. Its policies will provide business opportunities for the world.' The dual-circulation policy was formulated several months ago after the Trump administration imposed ban on Huawei and high-tech exports to China, which has hampered the business activities and growth of Chinese technology firms. The dual-circulation policy covers two prongs: internally China wants local firms to innovate their technologies and products, supported by local demand to reduce foreign reliance; and externally, China continues to open up its domestic market for foreign goods and foreign investments. While other countries are still combating Covid-19 pandemic and struggling to get their economies back on feet, China's economic rebound and effective policies have drawn more foreign direct investment (FDI) than the previous year. And while UNCTAD expects global FDI flows to shrink by up to 40% in 2020 due to the Covid pandemic, FDI into China rose 6.3% year-on-year to 899.38 billion yuan in the first 11 months of 2020, according to official data. The world's second largest economy expanded 4.9% in the third quarter compared to a year ago. The International Monetary Fund predicted in October China's GDP would expand 1.9% this year and growth would accelerate to 8.2% next year. Zhang sees more business opportunities for Asean countries and the Chinese people around the globe as he outlined areas that could attract investment opportunities, with special mention on Hainan that is being developed as a free trade area and international tourism/medical hub. 'Chinese economic strategies next year will be important for all, in particular overseas Chinese. Capital from overseas Chinese account for half of China's FDI and I believe they will be winners, ' said Zhang. He added China remembers that overseas Chinese were the first to invest in China and help in China's economic development after reformist leader Deng Xiaoping opened up the mainland in 1978. 'President Xi Jinping recently said overseas Chinese has provided the most important support for us to achieve China Dream, ' Zhang added. When a former WCES forum was held in Chongqing (China) in 2015, the then Chinese Vice President in his address revealed that 60% of FDIs into China came from the global Chinese diaspora – a powerful economic force worldwide. Zhang believes that China's trade and economic cooperation with Asean nations will be given greater focus after the signing of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), in which Asean nations are members. 'The RCEP's formation is good news for Chinese economy. It will lead to free trade and greater investment. As Asean's relation with China is friendly, it will benefit from China's policies, ' noted Zhang as he spoke from Beijing. Asean has become the biggest trading bloc of China this year, after overtaking the US and EU. Despite the Covid-19 crisis, total China-Asean bilateral trade rose 5.6% year on year to US$610bil for the first 11 months of 2020, according to a report by China's CGTN channel.Prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin delivering his opening keynote address through video at the hybrid summit. Concurring with the views of Zhang is Prof Dr Fan Gang, president of China Development Institute (CDI) and an influential economist. He said: 'With exports to Asean ranking as number one, China's cooperation with Asean is an important pillar for China's international cooperation.' Stating that China will continue with President Xi's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the head of China's independent think tank noted Beijing still has 'a lot of work to do' after overcoming the Covid-19 crisis earlier this year. China is now facing supply chain adjustment as substantial companies plan to relocate to other countries to achieve diversification, and the country has to do 'a lot of catching up' in the development of technology. Other challenges faced by the world's second largest economy include reforming its public health system, tackling trade war and economic decoupling with the US. 'We expect a lot of adjustments to be made in China, but we are determined to develop our economy further and continue to grow under the dual-circulation policy, ' said Prof Dr Fan. Despite having gone through a difficult and tumultuous year, Beijing's leadership has given itself thumbs up for its performance this year when the top leaders conducted self-appraisal this month. China has impressed the world for putting Covid-19 under control quickly and taking decisive actions to revive its economy, reported Xinhua on the government review of performance. China has also scored highly in sci-tech innovations, opening-up and improving people's livelihood, added Xinhua in its report. But to an outside observer like Malaysia's Prof Dr Chin Yew Sin, China has also made contributions to the world. The advisor for One Road One Belt Association said at the conference: 'China has given two gifts to the world: getting rid of abject poverty of 600 million people and introducing BRI. 'When China takes good care of its people, it will not create social problem for the world. And the BRI is a great manifestation of China helping other nations after its economy is strong.' Among the poor nations that have received extensive help from China in BRI projects are Pakistan, Africa, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar. Tan Sri Lee Kim Yew, founder and patron of WCES, was all praise for China's prompt action to help other nations with its masks and other personal protective equipment: 'China's peaceful rise has contributed much to the world. Without the strong manufacturing and supply chain of China, what could have happened to the world in terms of Covid-19 casualty?' As one of the topics of WCES 2020 conference was on BRI and sustainability in post-Covid new economy, green BRI had attracted new ideas. Dr Guo Wanda, executive vice president of Beijing-based CDI, opined China now needs green BRI and a sustainable financing for BRI projects. 'We need a sustainable financing for BRI projects. This can be innovative, taking into consideration social responsibility and development needs.' Green expert Alexandra Boakes Tracy, president of Hong Kong's Hoi Ping Ventures, said the way forward for BRI is to ensure projects will not harm the environment, climate and biodiversity. Her findings show that China is funding projects that are cutting through 21 protected areas in mainland South East Asia. The expectations that future BRI projects should be green may not be far-fetched given that China is a party to the Paris Agreement, and President Xi had pledged in September that China would adopt more vigorous policies and measures to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. In the green aspect, China has also made some progress. Independent Green BRI Center reported recently that China's climate change projects in Belt and Road nations 'have made remarkable progress'. In Jan-June 2020, BRI energy-related investments were climate-friendly for the first time, it said. As President Xi and US president-elect Joe Biden are on the same wavelength on climate change, speakers see the possibility of Washington being able to work together with Beijing in future on green subjects and sustainability. 'We are seeing a reboot of de-globalisation. Everybody wants to work together, as in RCEP and APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation). We are seeing multilateralism coming back, ' said Dr Wang Huiyao, a state counsellor and chairman of Centre for China and Globalisation. But green or not, the original objective of BRI to connect the world to facilitate movement of people and goods so that economic development could take place was emphasised by Prof Dr Kriengsak Chareonwongsak, a former Thai Member of Parliament and adviser to the Prime Minister. 'Connectivity is productivity. And this creates opportunities, particularly for Asean, ' said the head of the Institute of Future Studies for Development. He sees opportunities abound as China is now pushing for the development of smart cities, Health Silk Road and Tourism Silk Road. According to a 2017 report by the Asian Development Bank, developing Asia will need to invest US$1.7 trillion per year in infrastructure until 2030 to maintain its growth momentum, tackle poverty and respond to climate change. The one-day conference also saw speakers sharing their views on opportunities from digitalisation, AI and blockchain in the new economy, with China embarking on a Digital Silk Road. For WCES organising chairman Tan Sri Dr Michael Yeoh, the economic summit – with the theme 'connecting business, promoting shared prosperity and sustainability in the post-Covid new economy – has achieved its objectives. He said the conference has learnt about new opportunities in the new normal and cooperation between companies in China and Malaysia, and Asean. 'The participants were impressed by the Prime Minister's commitment (in his opening address) to ensure Malaysia remain business-friendly to attract investments.

This is my first time celebrating the anniversary since my assumption of office as the Chinese Ambassador to Malaysia. At this moment, my mind is filled with a myriad feelings, reflecting about my responsibilities and wishes. In the past few months, I have engaged extensively with Malaysian friends from government, Parliament, political parties, media, think tanks and local communities. I was deeply impressed by their passion and aspiration to promote China-Malaysia relations. The Malay proverb 'Air dicincang tiada putus' vividly reflects the millennial friendship between China and Malaysia. As we all know, the world, with its increasing instabilities and uncertainties, has yet to achieve full peace. The Covid-19 pandemic is ravaging the globe, traditional and non-traditional security threats are intertwined. Anachronistic practices of unilateralism and protectionism have been on the increase, driven by resurgent hegemonism and cold war mentality. Human development is confronted with multiple risks and challenges. Fortunately, China and Malaysia have always been supporting and helping each other, and pursuing mutual benefits, which has brought our cooperation to a higher level and yielded valuable and remarkable results. Chinese President Xi Jinping attaches great importance to China-Malaysia relations and has met with Malaysian leaders many times over the past few years. During his visit to Malaysia in 2013, the relationship between China and Malaysia was elevated to a comprehensive strategic partnership. Several days ago, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Malaysian Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin held a video conference at which they reached consensus on a wide range of issues, such as vaccine procurement and R&D, e-commerce, digital economy, high technology, and agriculture and food security; they also had an in-depth exchange of views on international and regional issues of common concern. Last month, Malaysian Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein had a fruitful talk with Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi during his visit to China. They signed a memorandum of understanding on China-Malaysia post-pandemic cooperation. These high level exchanges have played an irreplaceable and important role in the development of China-Malaysia relations. In the process of combating the pandemic, China and Malaysia have provided assistance of medical supplies and shared pandemic mitigation experience with each other. China has considered Malaysia a priority in vaccine cooperation and has cooperated comprehensively with the Malaysian side on vaccine procurement, R&D and production. In 2020, the bilateral trade volume and China's investment in Malaysia's manufacturing sector grew by 4.2% and 10.3% respectively, while Malaysia's exports to China witnessed a historical high. China has remained Malaysia's largest trading partner for 12 consecutive years, and is the largest foreign direct investment source in Malaysia's manufacturing sector for five consecutive years. Major projects such as 'Two Countries, Twin Parks' and East Coast Rail Link are ongoing smoothly. The mutually beneficial ties between both sides have become more resilient, pushing forward our cooperation against the odds. The pandemic may separate us physically but it can never prevent us from connecting with each other. Despite the difficulties of face-to-face interactions under the new normal of pandemic prevention and control, we held a series of online events in a creative way including '2020 Malaysia-China Year of Culture and Tourism – Digital Silk Road', and provided support to multiple virtual activities across various sectors and at all levels between both countries. The people-to-people exchanges have maintained their strong momentum, receiving enthusiastic responses from our people. Only in hard times can courage and perseverance be manifested. Only after polishing can a piece of jade be finer. China-Malaysia relationship has demonstrated resilience and vitality through tough times. Our friends have shown their enthusiasm in supporting China-Malaysia friendship. These facts made us not only highly encouraged but also very confident and motivated to further promote China-Malaysia relations. In the post-pandemic era, I hope both sides can enhance cooperation in the following areas. First, we should deepen anti-pandemic cooperation and promote solid progress in cooperation on healthcare, medicine, vaccine R&D and other areas to achieve an early victory against the virus and a rapid recovery of economy and society. I also hope we can resume offline communications across various sectors and through all levels at an early date to enhance people-to-people exchanges and promote mutual understanding between the two peoples. Second, we should strengthen the synergies of our development strategies, promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and steadily advance cooperation on major projects. We should nurture new growth areas for digital economic cooperation and tap into the potential of cooperation in areas such as 5G, big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, smart cities and cross-border e-commerce to foster new growth drivers. Third, we should enhance communication and coordination on major international and regional issues, jointly safeguard multilateralism and free trade, promote world peace and stability, and play an active role in building a community with a shared future for humankind. The wind is blowing and the sail is lifting. Let us work together to navigate the giant vessel of China-Malaysia friendship through the waves and forge ahead towards an ever brighter future.

56;G7 to raise US$600bil to counter China's initiative;;2022-06-27 16:00:00;full;https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2022/06/28/g7-to-raise-us600bil-to-counter-chinas-initiative;thestar.com.my;Project to support low and middle-income countries;Top shots: Leaders of the G7 at the gathering in southern Germany. Biden and other leaders relaunched the newly renamed 'Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment' at the annual event. — AFP BERLIN: Group of Seven (G7) leaders pledged to raise US$600bil (RM2.64 trillion) in private and public funds over five years to finance needed infrastructure in developing countries and counter China's older, multitrillion-dollar Belt and Road project. US President Joe Biden and other G7 leaders relaunched the newly renamed 'Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment,' at their annual gathering being held this year at Schloss Elmau in southern Germany. Biden said the United States would mobilise US$200bil (RM881.2bil) in grants, federal funds and private investment over five years to support projects in low and middle-income countries that help tackle climate change as well as improve global health, gender equity and digital infrastructure. 'I want to be clear. This isn't aid or charity. It's an investment that will deliver returns for everyone,' said Biden, adding that it would allow countries to 'see the concrete benefits of partnering with democracies.' Biden said hundreds of billions of additional dollars could come from multilateral development banks, development finance institutions, sovereign wealth funds and others. Europe will mobilise €300bil (RM1.39 trillion) for the initiative over the same period to build up a sustainable alternative to China's Belt and Road Initiative, which Chinese President Xi Jinping launched in 2013, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the gathering. The leaders of Italy, Canada and Japan also spoke about their plans, some of which have already been announced separately. French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson were not present, but their countries are also participating. China's investment scheme involves development and programmes in over 100 countries aimed at creating a modern version of the ancient Silk Road trade route from Asia to Europe. White House officials said the plan has provided little tangible benefit for many developing countries. Biden highlighted several flagship projects, including a US$2bil (RM8.8bil) solar development project in Angola with support from the Commerce Department, the US Export-Import Bank, US firm AfricaGlobal Schaffer and US project developer Sun Africa. Together with G7 members and the European Union (EU), Washington will also provide US$3.3mil (RM14.5mil) in technical assistance to Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal as it develops an industrial-scale flexible multi-vaccine manufacturing facility in that country that can eventually produce Covid-19 and other vaccines, a project that also involves the EU. The US Agency for International Development will also commit up to US$50mil (RM220mil) over five years to the World Bank's global Childcare Incentive Fund. Global Citizen vice-president Friederike Roder said the pledges of investment could be 'a good start' toward greater engagement by G7 countries in developing nations and could underpin stronger global growth for all. G7 countries on average provide only 0.32% of their gross national income, less than half of the 0.7% promised, in development assistance, she said. 'But without developing countries, there will be no sustainable recovery of the world economy,' she said. — Reuters;cxense.com;1823;news;MY;en;;https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2022/06/28/1638637.jpg;False;;19.29012;3bc340160dcac8658994288fa2a67f4a;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}
57;Belt, Road a boon for global cooperation;The Star Online;2023-06-07 16:00:00;full;https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2023/06/08/belt-road-a-boon-for-global-cooperation;thestar.com.my;After setting up a delivery services venture between China and South-East Asia in 2019, Best Inc of Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, says it has handled only a limited number of online orders placed by…;"BEIJING: After setting up a delivery services venture between China and South-East Asia in 2019, Best Inc of Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, says it has handled only a limited number of online orders placed by South-East Asian consumers through Chinese eCommerce platforms.
 
Best had hoped to expand its presence in Belt and Road Initiative-related markets. But at the time, they were new to the market and not yet widely known.
 
Things, however, have changed significantly. The company, which has continued to add to its infrastructure in the region, said it has experienced significant growth in recent years.
 
Driven by the increasing demand, Best now ships dozens of standard twenty-foot equivalent units of containers from Chinese ports to South-East Asian countries each month. The company said its business in that category witnessed a 45% year-on-year (y-o-y) surge in the first quarter of 2023.
 
'The tangible expansion of the BRI and its various forms of cooperation have greatly contributed to the remarkable growth of Best's sales.
 
'Among the notable impacts, our warehouses in Malaysia have experienced a significant upsurge in transportation services for large and heavy cross-border goods from China in recent months,' said Zhu Jiashu, deputy general manager of Best Global, the group's international arm.
 
Best to date has established service branches in countries and regions such as Japan, Australia and South-East Asia, and built a logistics network in five countries, including Vietnam and Thailand in the Asia-Pacific region.
 
To facilitate inclusive development through cooperative projects around the world, China proposed the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road in 2013.
 
Known collectively as the BRI, the initiative has grown into one of the most promising platforms for international cooperation, forging a new pathway toward inclusive globalisation that delivers shared benefits, officials said.
 
Market watchers said a series of big-ticket projects like high-speed railway projects in Indonesia, port expansion in Djibouti and a nuclear power facility in the United Kingdom are all shining examples of achievements under the initiative.
 
Apart from developing game-changing infrastructure projects such as railroads, hospitals, power plants, as well as bulk and container ports in countries in need, the BRI has created growth in areas such as trade in services, new foreign trade formats and digital and green development internationally, said Gao Lingyun, director of the international investment division at the Institute of World Economics and Politics, which is part of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
 
With steady progress in advancing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, the initiative is expected to continue to make emerging economies stronger and shorten the growth gap between landlocked and coastal areas in many parts of the world, Gao said.
 
State-owned Power Construction Corp of China, or PowerChina, announced in early May that it had signed an engineering, procurement and construction contract to build the Kahama photovoltaic power project, the first of its kind in Tanzania. Such contracts are common in the construction industry, officials said.
 
Designed with a total installed capacity of 10.33 megawatts, the project will include surveys and design, equipment purchases and construction and installation of the photovoltaic zone and a 3-km power export line.Once operational, the project will improve Tanzania's power source structure, promote the development of the country's clean energy strategy and boost its economic development, said Chen Guanfu, vice-president of PowerChina's overseas business unit.
 
The BRI has put the idea of globalisation into practice, officials said. By connecting infrastructure, it helps to boost trade, attract investment and foster people-to-people exchanges, said Zhang Jianping, deputy-director of the academic committee of the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation under the Commerce Ministry.
 
In terms of advancing international production capacity cooperation and modern infrastructure projects, Chinese companies have also been working with foreign partners such as Germany's Siemens AG, France's Schneider Electric SE and Switzerland's ABB Group to develop infrastructure in economies covered by the initiative, he said.
 
China Energy Engineering Corp Ltd, a Beijing-based State-owned enterprise, announced in March that it had started to build a large-scale wind power project in Uzbekistan.
 
The project is expected to generate jobs in the Central Asian country, as well as set an example of China-Saudi Arabia third-party market cooperation in jointly developing the BRI, said Xue Danfeng, deputy board chairman of Energy China's international group.
 
Financing for the wind farm project in Uzbekistan is being provided by ACWA Power, a Riyadh, Saudi Arabia-based developer and operator of power generation and water desalination facilities with a presence in 10 countries, largely in the Middle East, Africa and South-East Asia.
 
The Bash and Dzhankeldy wind power project, located in Bukhara province, is expected to have the largest installed capacity of its kind in Central Asia. It includes the construction of two 500-megawatt wind power plants and associated power transmission lines.
 
Taking full advantage of substantial prevailing winds in the region, the project, once operational, is expected to provide more than 3.5 billion kilowatt-hours of power annually, representing a reduction of 1.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, Xue said.
 
It is expected to help millions of people in Uzbekistan by enhancing the local power supply, improving the local power structure and transforming the energy structure in the country, he said.
 
By mid-February, China had signed cooperation agreements with 151 countries and 32 international organisations under the BRI, and its annual trade value with BRI-related countries and regions almost doubled from 2013 to 2022, according to the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.
 
China's foreign trade has been boosted by closer business ties and complementary trade structures with many trading partners.
 
The nation's trade with countries and regions participating in the BRI rose 16.8% y-o-y to 3.43 trillion yuan (US$482bil or RM2.2 trillion) in the first quarter.
 
That growth rate was 12 percentage points higher than the overall growth rate of China's foreign trade during the same period, said the General Administration of Customs. China's exports of intermediate goods to those economies reached 1.1 trillion yuan (RM711bil), up 18.2% on a yearly basis. Intermediate goods are often used to produce a finished product.
 
Those exports accounted for 54% of the country's total exports to BRI-related markets during the same period.
 
Many BRI-related economies are entering a new era of environmentally conscious growth and industrial upgrading.
 
That has contributed to Chinese exports of automotive components to those markets jumping 40.5% y-o-y between January and March. Exports of lithium batteries to those markets surged 50.3% and electrical control device exports rose 23.9% on a yearly basis, Customs officials said.
 
China has emerged as a crucial contributor of global public goods and a proactive responder to uncertainties and risks, said Wang Wen, executive dean of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. That is, China has become a greater contributor to global prosperity, Wang said.
 
Such public goods provided by China now cover a broad spectrum, ranging from anti-epidemic products to frameworks that promote international cooperation such as the BRI, Wang said, stressing that the BRI also provides Chinese solutions for reforming the global governance system.

The G7, whose leaders are meeting in southwestern England, has been searching for a coherent response to the growing assertiveness of Xi after China's surging economic and military rise over the past 40 years. U.S. President Joe Biden and other G7 leaders hope their plan, known as the Build Back Better World (B3W) initiative, will provide a transparent infrastructure partnership to help narrow the $40 trillion needed by developing nations by 2035, the White House said. ""This is not just about confronting or taking on China,"" a senior official in Biden's administration said. ""But until now we haven't offered a positive alternative that reflects our values, our standards and our way of doing business."" The United States later said there was a G7 consensus on the need for a shared approach to China on trade and human rights. The G7 and its allies will use the B3W initiative to mobilise private-sector capital in areas such as climate, health and health security, digital technology, and gender equity and equality, the White House added. It was not immediately clear how exactly the plan would work or how much capital it would ultimately allocate. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) scheme, which Xi launched in 2013, involves development and investment initiatives that would stretch from Asia to Europe and beyond. More than 100 countries have signed agreements with China to cooperate in BRI projects like railways, ports, highways and other infrastructure. Critics say Xi's plan to create a modern version of the ancient Silk Road trade route to link China with Asia, Europe and beyond is a vehicle for the expansion of Communist China. Beijing says such doubts betray the ""imperial hangover"" of many Western powers that humiliated China for centuries. CHINA'S RISE Leaders of the G7 - the United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, Italy, France and Japan - want to use their gathering in the seaside resort of Carbis Bay to show the world that the richest democracies can offer an alternative to China's growing clout. The re-emergence of China as a leading global power is considered to be one of the most significant geopolitical events of recent times, alongside the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union that ended the Cold War. China in 1979 had an economy that was smaller than Italy's, but after opening to foreign investment and introducing market reforms, it has become the world's second-largest economy and is a global leader in a range of new technologies. The U.S. official said until now, the West had failed to offer a positive alternative to the ""lack of transparency, poor environmental and labour standards, and coercive approach"" of the Chinese government that had left many countries worse off. According to a Refinitiv database, as of mid-last year, more than 2, 600 projects at a cost of $3.7 trillion were linked to the BRI, although the Chinese foreign ministry said last June that about 20% of projects had been seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the G7 plan, the United States will work with the U.S. Congress to supplement existing development financing and to ""collectively catalyze hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investment"", the White House said. CRITICISM OVER CAMPS Biden made ""forceful comments"" to G7 leaders about the need to make a strong statement on Washington and rights group say is the use of forced labour in China, but there was a ""spectrum of how far different countries are willing to go"" in their criticism in a final communique from the three-day summit, another U.S. official said. The U.S. official later said the G7 had reached consensus on the need for a shared approach on ""non-market economic practices"" and on human rights abuses, and to coordinate on supply-chain resilience. The United States has pushed for specific language in the communique about alleged forced labour in the China's Xinjiang region, officials said. U.N. experts and rights groups estimate over a million people, mainly Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, have been detained in recent years in a vast system of camps in Xinjiang. China denies all accusations of forced labour or abuse. It initially denied the camps existed, but has since said they are vocational centres and are designed to combat extremism. In late 2019, China said all people in the camps had ""graduated"". The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. - Reuters";thestar.com.my;1823;business;MY;en;[];https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2021/06/13/1182403.JPG;False;;18.758673;943bb0744efcaa31c1f05965b13365df;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

FOR entrepreneurs, business leaders, government leaders, diplomats and professionals keen to look for post-pandemic investment opportunities in China, Asean and the Asian region, you may not want to miss the coming 2020 World Chinese Economic Summit (WCES) on Dec 21. Participants to this annual bilingual (English/Mandarin) international business and economic forum can expect to learn more about the latest Chinese policies, opportunities presented by the just-concluded Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and what holds for the world in the era of new US President Joe Biden. As the primary mission of the WCES is to connect global Chinese diaspora and to promote closer cooperation between China, Asean and countries in the Asia Pacific, it will be relevant for Asians – particularly Malaysians – to attend this conference. It is significant to note that in the WCES forum held in Chongqing (China) in 2014, then Chinese vice-president in his keynote address revealed that 60% of FDIs into China came from the global Chinese diaspora – a powerful economic force with their combined wealth worldwide. For those with an eye largely on China, they may be excited to learn that among the prominent speakers at this forum entitled Connecting Business, Promoting Shared Prosperity and Sustainability in the Post-Covid New Economy is Prof Dr Fan Gang, one of China's most influential economists. He is adviser to several departments of the central government and some provincial governments.Looking to the future: Yeoh (left) and Lee are all geared up for the upcoming WCES which will be held in a hybrid format due to Covid-19. The conference will look at post-pandemic investment opportunities in China, Asean and the Asian region. In international conferences, the remarks made by Dr Fan Gang, previously a member of the Monetary Policy Committee of China's central bank, are followed closely for clues on the thinking of the Chinese government on economic development. Based in Beijing, the director of the National Economic Research Institute (NERI) and chairman of the China Development Institute (CDI) has been a Fellow of the World Economic Forum, Fellow of the Chinese Economist Society (USA) and a consultant to the World Bank. With the conclusion of China's third international import expo held in Shanghai in November, and President Xi Jinping's promise that China will continue to open up and be 'the market of the world', many see China as providing opportunities for virus-hit international corporations. China, with over 400 million affluent middle-class people among its 1.4 billion population, is a ready consumer market for exporters of quality goods to the Middle Kingdom. And with China seeing speedy economic recovery after overcoming the novel coronavirus pandemic earlier this year, Beijing is leading the world in economic recovery. The world's second largest economy expanded 4.9% in the third quarter compared to a year ago. The International Monetary Fund said in October China's GDP is predicted to expand 1.9% this year and growth will accelerate to 8.2% next year. The WCES conference, to be officially opened by Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, will start with a keynote speech by Dr Fan, followed tentatively by Malaysia's Transport Minister Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong. The conference's welcome remarks will be made by Tan Sri Michael Yeoh, organising chairman of WCES; and introductory speech will be by Tan Sri Lee Kim Yew, founder and patron of WCES. The first session of the conference after the opening keynote session will be China and the World in the Age of Disruption and the Post-Covid New Normal.This session will look into how global demand and supply chains have been disrupted and how China can lead the world in the age of disruption. What will the future hold in 2021 after US presidential election? What are the challenges ahead? Participants will also be guided on the abundant opportunities in finance, technology and tourism in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao by Dr Wilfred Wong Ying-wai, president of Sands China Ltd; Stephen Philips, director-general of Invest Hong Kong; and Ravindra Ngo, founder of Invest in Cambodia. 'The GBA is a particularly exciting area. Its development and progress is amazing. Malaysians and other participants must look at this area and the new policies of Hainan,' said Tan Sri Lee in an interview with Sunday Star. The session The Greater Bay Area and Asean – Maximising Opportunities and Collaboration will look into opportunities offered by the world's largest bay area, as well as how Asean entrepreneurs can make use of the GBA as a springboard into China and how China entrepreneurs can succeed in Asean. Lee is also excited that one of the sessions at WCES conference will focus on blockchain, in which he has ventured into. 'China's digital economy is very strong and we have a special forum on blockchain – an important new area,' Lee said. The session The Digital Silk Road will explore new opportunities in digitisation, AI, e-commerce, robotics, the Internet of Things, 5G and blockchain. Not to miss in this session is a discussion on challenges faced in the rapid progress. The WCES was founded 11 years ago. It first began as an event focused on promoting business cooperation, trade and investments, and connecting the global Chinese diaspora, catering more for ethnic Chinese around the world. Since then, the WCES has grown into a leading international forum that has attracted Chinese and non-Chinese businessmen, government leaders, professionals and think-tanks, according to Yeoh. 'This conference is probably the only international conference on Chinese diaspora held largely in English. Hence, we have a lot of non-Chinese speakers,' said Tan Sri Yeoh, also the president of KSI Strategic Institute for Asia Pacific. Yeoh believes this conference will not only be beneficial to Chinese entrepreneurs in this region, it will also help non-Chinese to understand China and the region – and of course to explore business opportunities. The 2020 conference, to be graced by Sultan of Selangor at the presentation of lifetime achievement awards during lunch session, will also promise an update on the US$1 trillion Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China. The BRI has enhanced business and transport connectivity in the BRI countries. Many countries in South-East Asia and South Asia have benefited from the BRI connectivity. Going forward, Yeoh sees it timely to look at the challenges facing BRI post Covid and the new business opportunities. Dr Guo Wanda from CDI of China, adviser to Thai Prime Minister Prof Dr Kriengsak Chareonwongsak and Datuk Seri Dr Chai Kee Kan from Malaysia's KK Group of Companies will be there to share their views and experience. Among the non-Chinese speakers/panellists invited to the forum are David Morris, vice- president of UN ESCAP Sustainable Business Network and senior research fellow of Beijing Foreign Studies University and Sir Danny Alexander, vice president and corporate secretary of Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The experts from China are Dr Ma Weihua, former president and CEO of China Merchants Bank; Dr Wang Hui Yao, chairman of Centre for China & Globalisation and Counsellor to the State Council; Dr Yan Lijin, chairman of China Silk Road Group Ltd; and Dr Guo Wanda, executive vice-president of CDI. Some speakers are successful investors in China. These include Tan Sri Lim Gait Tong from Farlim Group Bhd, Dr Edward Tse of Gao Feng Advisory Company, Dr Wilfred Wong Ying-wai, president of Sands China Ltd. Apart from MCA president Dr Wee, the other local politicians with government positions are Datuk Chong Sin Woon, chairman of Port Klang Authority and secretary-general of the MCA; and Senator Datuk Dr Ma Han Soon, deputy MCA president and deputy Minister of Education.

There will be a lot of sharing of experience, knowledge and contacts,' said the key organiser of the event. He said in the past, the WCES has helped to promote better understanding of China to the West and vice versa. It has also helped to forge a lot of friendship that led to new ventures. For Lee, who controls property group Country Heights, the most important question for most businessmen now is: 'After Covid-19, what's best for businessmen? Who can help me to make money when everyone is scared to be near each other?' The conference, he said, may be able to provide some pointers and guidance on how to overcome this dilemma.

60;A new era of international economic cooperation;Search Scholar Series;2022-01-03 11:15:00;timezone unknown;https://www.thestar.com.my/opinion/columnists/search-scholar-series/2022/01/03/a-new-era-of-international-economic-cooperation;thestar.com.my;WITH an increasingly interdependent world economy, international economic cooperation is typically used to facilitate the processes of trade and investment. However, we see dramatic changes in the…;WITH an increasingly interdependent world economy, international economic cooperation is typically used to facilitate the processes of trade and investment. However, we see dramatic changes in the traditional definitions and functions of international economic cooperation. This has heightened the desire to revise the traditional international economic cooperation policies. One such move is through the introduction of the 'Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)' by China. Among others, the BRI redefines international economic cooperation in two ways. Firstly, BRI focuses on a larger trade area, involving businesses of various size classifications and market sectors through e-commerce. Traditionally, international trade is promoted through regional integration agreements, which are formed to remove tariffs on trade (free trade area), applying a common tariff structure (customs union) and permit free movement of factors of production, goods, and services (common market). Besides that, the traditional international trade system focuses on large enterprises. However, new international trade patterns have emerged with the rapid development of e-commerce. The use of the Internet and e-commerce applications has effectively improved the trade process, making it seamless and cost effective. E-commerce platforms enable small businesses and micro-entrepreneurs to access global market opportunities. Hence, countries with more advanced digital technology are more likely to benefit from this trade liberalisation. In the context of BRI, China has already made great strides in this direction with efforts to expand their cross-border e-commerce pilot zones. Specifically, China's President Xi Jinping announced on Nov 4, 2021 that China would promote 'Silk Road e-commerce'. This plan is imperative to countries participating in the BRI as it focuses on enhancing the infrastructure construction supporting cross-border e-commerce. Secondly, global value chains (GVCs), which are a big part of today's international trade, can be further strengthened through BRI. Under traditional international trade practises, each country produces and exports final products, i.e., finished goods and services which do not require further production. However, with GVCs, each country focuses on a specialised segment of production based on their comparative advantage in technology and factor endowments. Through this, while the production process is fragmented, there is an overall reduction in total production cost and an increase in production efficiency. The increase in cross-border production fragmentation has led to a more complex international production network. However, this is simplified through BRI as it offers infrastructure connectivity, and trade and investment enhancement which stands to strengthen international production networks. International trade plays a major role in Malaysia's economic development as we are a well-known trading nation. Malaysia was recognised as the world's 25th trading nation in 2019 by the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Malaysia's trade performance in 2020 remained resilient despite the Covid-19 pandemic. Malaysia's total exports and imports stood at RM980.99bil and RM796.19bil, respectively. Total trade constituted 117% of the gross domestic product (GDP), reflecting the high intensity of Malaysia's trade. During the 1990s, the high degree of trade openness catapulted Malaysia's participation in GVCs. Nonetheless, based on the data from Trade in Value-Added (TiVA) OECD, Malaysia's GVC participation position has declined in the past decades, particularly in the backward GVC participation. This analysis illustrates the need for Malaysia to transform its production strategy and shift its focus on human capital development and technological innovation to remain competitive in the international arena. Despite the many downsides of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is an opportune time for Malaysian small businesses and micro-entrepreneurs to launch their businesses online and participate in e-commerce. According to the Department of Statistics Malaysia, there was an increase of 32.7% in e-commerce income from RM675.4bil to RM896.4bil in 2020, signalling an increased adoption of e-commerce by Malaysian sellers and buyers. This is supported by a report from Digital Malaysia 2020 which states that approximately 50% of the Malaysian population are now active online buyers. However, many businesses are yet to take advantage of the benefits of cross-border e-commerce. For instance, in 2019, Malaysia's e-commerce income from the local market segment stood at RM591.8bil but only recorded an income of RM84.5bil from the international market. Malaysia has been involved in China's BRI initiative since 2013 and has potential to reap various benefits from this collaboration. Through BRI, we can narrow the digital divide and encourage specialisation in GVCs from the infrastructure and resources that are generated from BRI. Furthermore, BRI has brought about many mutual projects such as China-Malaysia Port Alliance (CMPA) which brings mutual benefit in terms of bigger trade volume to both countries, and bilateral tie-ups to facilitate the cross-border movements of goods and services. Most importantly, this new international cooperation has potential to ensure that Malaysia is not left behind. Dr Ong Sheue Li is a Senior Lecturer at University of Malaya.

Over time to accommodate trading activities, the BRI has been associated with developing infrastructures. Indeed, infrastructure investment is a key aspect of the BRI. Hence, foreign exchange inflows through international financial connectivity are crucial. Since its inception in 2013, China's overseas investment strategy has been steadily increasing. However, the total investment from China into the 138 BRI countries declined to about US$103billion in 2019 and US$47 billion in 2020, possibly attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic. Financial connectivity - an important pillar of the BRI - requires joint investment and financing cooperation from all countries. There are several important channels to achieving greater financial connectivity. First, an enabling financial ecosystem across borders can help support inclusive growth. Major infrastructure developments presented by the BRI will not only require extensive capital flow, but it has to be managed safely. According to International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Christine Lagarde at the 2019 Belt and Road Forum Session on Financial Connectivity, capital flow openness holds the potential to reduce financing costs, improve the efficiency of the financial sector and support high-quality investments and employment. However, capital markets liberalization requires proper regulation, with special attention on fiscal stability in order to succeed. The BRI features long-term projects which require substantial financing demands, and this is where financial development can play an important role. Financial development emphasizes on the ability to operate independently on an international market, as well as the capacity to generate long-term investments and inculcate financial sustainability. Next, promoting financial connectivity calls for an increased presence of financial institutions and services in an expedited manner. Financial institutions should be encouraged to expand their network and offer financial services to facilitate trade and investment activities related to the BRI. This also includes supporting financial services such as risk analysis and management, as well as funds settlement. To support the development of the countries and enhance financial cooperation in the region, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Development Bank were established. These banks act as the financial arm of the BRI and aim to attract international capital on a financial cooperation platform that is transparent, equitable, and mutually beneficial. A newer channel for a more effective BRI is to promote financial inclusion. According to the IMF, in 2018, almost half of the adult population in low and middle-income Asia-Pacific economies did not possess a bank account, and less than 10 percent had borrowed from a financial institution. China has seen significant progress in promoting financial inclusion, where community banks represented by rural credit unions strive to improve rural financial services and pool local savings. Discussions of fintech adoption under the BRI - often referred to as the digital Silk Road - have paved the way for other countries to transition into promoting mobile and internet payment. The Asian Financial Cooperation Association (AFCA) was established in 2017 to provide extensive support for financial connectivity in Asia. The AFCA is devoted to building an exchange and cooperation platform for Asian financial institutions by encouraging regional financial resources integration while jointly safeguarding financial stability and supporting the development of countries in the region. Furthermore, Chinese development and commercial banks such as the China Development Bank, EXIM Bank and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China have supported numerous projects in several BRI-linked countries, such as Pakistan, Indonesia and Malaysia. By partnering with Chinese operators, BRI partner countries can benefit from China's technological competency and dexterity. Over the years, Malaysia has positioned itself as a vital partner of China for trade and investment, given its longstanding relationship with China. Its welcoming stance has tapped on the BRI to increase inflows of FDI into the country, with investments spread across various sectors. Leveraging on the BRI framework, cooperation and joint investments between these two countries are pivotal. In October 2018, a joint report on BRI and Southeast Asia was launched in Kuala Lumpur. The report highlights ASEAN and China's collaboration and outlines strategic ways to ensure the success of the BRI in the region. Going forward, BRI investments should focus on financially sustainable projects to ensure the continued success of financial connectivity. The BRI Green Development Coalition (BRIGC) established in December 2020 aims to do just that. BRIGC encourages investors to inculcate environmental impact assessments and risk management, to ensure that projects implemented under the BRI minimise environmental-related damages. To recap, the BRI allows foreign exchange inflow through international activities, with high potential to promote monetary expansion in the economy. High financial connectivity with the ability to safeguard a stable financial system is crucial for all BRI countries, as it leads to rapid improvements in quality of life.

Having been engaged in the international trade of agricultural commodities for 20 years, Song has been committed to facilitating cooperation between overseas source suppliers and Chinese food processors. This time, what attracted him was the market potential of Xinjiang's high-quality agricultural and forestry products. In China, Xinjiang's fruits and agricultural products do not need to be advertised because of their high quality with low pollution. Song and his team want to scale up the application of low-temperature direct extraction technology in Xinjiang to extract products such as jujube, pomegranate, and cistanche into liquid. They also want to solve the problems of scattered lands and short planting seasons by using vehicle-mounted mobile factories. He has also worked with Xinjiang's agriculture, forestry, and commerce departments to study how to turn agricultural products sold in sacks into high-value-added industrial products sold by grams. Along with Song, more than 100 Chinese academics and entrepreneurs have made suggestions for Xinjiang's future economic development at a high-level forum over the week. ""Xinjiang has ushered in an important period of strategic opportunities for high-quality development,"" Bai Chunli, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), said. ""High-quality development"" is a buzzword experts in different fields pay close attention to. Qu Jian, vice dean of the Shenzhen-based China Development Institute, was one of the planners of Xinjiang's two state-level economic development zones 13 years ago. He said the same as the coastal areas, Xinjiang used to rely on robust investment in fixed assets and labor employment for growth. Now, Xinjiang has entered the transition period of economic development, increasingly driven by scientific and technological progress, educational innovation, and institutional innovation, Qu said. In the first half of this year, Xinjiang's GDP grew by 4.9 percent, ranking third among all provinces and autonomous regions in China. From 2012 to 2021, Xinjiang's GDP increased from 740 billion yuan (109.6 billion U.S. dollars) to 1.6 trillion yuan, with an average annual growth rate of 7.5 percent. Before the forum, more than 40 academicians from the CAS and the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE) did field research in Xinjiang for about a week on sectors including energy, the chemical industry, water resources, and the digital economy. With rich first-hand data and respective industrial experience, they submitted advisory reports. Shao Xinyu, vice minister of science and technology, said the ministry would promote the high-quality development of various science and technology parks. It would also drive cotton and wind-energy innovation centers and accelerate the training of academic leaders and community-level agricultural science and technology personnel in Xinjiang. ""We encourage academicians to bring their research achievements and talents to Xinjiang. We support academicians in launching major projects and platforms in Xinjiang to conduct core research and tackle primary scientific and technological problems,"" said Li Xiaohong, president of the CAE. How to carry out innovative international cooperation in Xinjiang, also known as the core area of the Silk Road Economic Belt, is another topic of interest for experts and scholars. Experts have noticed that the China-Europe freight train service and cross-border cooperation zone achieved remarkable results. Xinjiang plays a significant role in Eurasian economic and trade logistics. Industrial upgrading in Xinjiang will also support the Belt and Road Initiative in the future. In the first half of this year, 6,195 freight trains between China and Central Asia reached Kazakhstan by way of Xinjiang, a significant increase despite the pressure of the pandemic. Xinjiang is rich in energy resources, with wind and solar energy reserves ranking first in China. In the context of China's promise to achieve carbon peak and neutrality, many experts mapped out realistic paths for Xinjiang to make clean and efficient use of coal, promote green and low-carbon technologies, and promote the renewable energy industry. After the forum, Song, determined to start a business in Xinjiang, will go to the vast agricultural areas in southern Xinjiang with his team to land his project as soon as possible. Many entrepreneurs like Song have attended the forum on-site or via webcast. For them, Xinjiang, a resource-rich region at the forefront of China's westward opening-up, could be a great place to invest in the future.";thestar.com.my;1823;news;MY;en;Cao Bin,Gu Yu,Xiong Congru,Zhang Xiaolong,unreguser;https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/newTsol_logo_socmedia.png;False;;17.737751;b365b5f7cab7de6e781dc99ad4cff859;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

For a decade, China and Asean have enjoyed growing connectivity, deepening economic integration and robust business ties.
 
Since 2020, Asean has surpassed the European Union to become China's largest trading partner, marking the official formation of a new regional economic and trade cooperation pattern in which China and Asean are each other's largest trading partners.
 
Furthermore, China is the second highest contributor of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Indonesia.
 
In 2022, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) came into effect, which presented China with a year-on-year trade increase of 15% with Asean.
 
As the two economies partnership continues to deepen, beyond trade, we expect to see China's growing footprint in Asean through FDI, planting seeds for growth in China and Asean's shared future.
 
Fast-growing regions
 
China and Asean, as two of the world's fastest growing regions, are highly complementary industrial structures.
 
South-East Asia enjoys strong manufacturing and production capacity, rising and young domestic consumer population, as well as increasing urbanisation.
 
The region's growing trade and capital flows, continuing digital transformation, and greater focus on sustainability are creating tremendous opportunities.
 
China's modern economy was built on the strength of a solid and often low-tech manufacturing sector, making it the world's single largest manufacturer today.
 
As China continues to develop and move up the value chain – toward producing more high-tech manufactures and services and investing in more research and development – it is likely that some of the country's lower-tech, labour-intensive manufacturing will be up for grabs.
 
It is expected that Asean will emerge as the third pillar of Asian growth alongside China and India.
 
The changing landscape of China's manufacturing sector will present significant opportunities for Asean to capture some of China's manufacturing, and to become a major source of consumption for the world.
 
Production shift
 
The garment and textile industry is the most obvious candidate for moving production out of China to other Asian countries.
 
There are also examples of intermediate-input and other tech manufacturing leaving China with countries like Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia picking up electronics work.
 
And as more companies seek geographic diversification and adopt the 'China+1' strategy, South-East Asia will continue to gain market share – as well as a greater slice of global FDI as the centre of gravity of global manufacturing continues to shift.
 
FDI flows into Asean as a percentage of total world flows rose to a record high of 11% in 2021, almost on par with China (12%). China has become the joint largest source country for FDI into Asean (not counting intra-Asean) in 2021, on par with Japan.
 
While the process was partially disrupted by the pandemic, after the reopening, China's investment push into Asean will continue to thrive. Most of mainland China's FDI projects in Asean in 2022 fall into sectors where recipient countries have a competitive advantage.
 
Over the years, China has been investing heavily in Asean's booming manufacturing sector, ranging from the electric vehicle (EV) supply chain in Indonesia and Thailand, to consumer electronics in Vietnam, as well as Singapore's promising pharmaceuticals.
 
For example, Chinese investment has been key in facilitating Indonesia's nickel smelter boom, a key input for producing EV batteries.
 
China-based CATL signed an agreement with Indonesia's state-owned enterprises PT Antam and PT Industri Baterai Indonesia to jointly develop an almost US$6bil (RM28bil) mining-to-batteries ecosystem.
 
Indonesia is not the only candidate for China's FDI along the EV supply chain. BYD, China's top EV producer, is planning to build a production centre in Thailand, with a capacity of production of 150,000 EVs per annum.
 
This will make Thailand its first production hub in Asean, partly thanks to the country's generous subsidy which is as much as 150,000 baht (RM20,055) per EV.
 
Solar power
 
Elsewhere, China's investment in Malaysia is equally important. Risen Energy, China's solar energy firm, announced its first facility investment in South-East Asia, worth U$10bil (RM46bil)-plus over 15 years, to manufacture high-efficiency photovoltaic modules.
 
Chinese firms have also made a move in Singapore. In late 2022, two Chinese firms, WuXi Biologics and WuXi AppTec, announced a S$4bil (RM14bil) investment into the country's pharmaceutical manufacturing, the second-largest sub-sector after electronics.
 
The spreading supply chain across Asia is already resulting in increased capability and production quality in the countries closest to China.
 
Continued investment, the right partnerships and new trade agreements such as the RCEP, will likely bring to the wider South-East Asia region a degree of the economic advancement China has already been enjoying.
 
Asean has the potential to become one of the world's key manufacturing hubs.
 
The region has favourable demographics, comparatively lower wages, is strategically located and boasts production synergies. The opportunity for South-East Asia countries to 'grab' some of China's manufacturing advantage is ripe.
 
Yet, to attract more global production and remain competitive with China, deeper efficiency improvements will need to be implemented in the region.
 
Despite the shadows cast by the global pandemic in the last few years and other market uncertainties, we see the coming years as a period of great promise for South-East Asia, brimming with potential ranging from sustainability and digital technology to trade and wealth.
 
This also creates unprecedented opportunities for Chinese companies that are seeking continuous growth and global presence in the post-Covid era.
 
The key to unlocking opportunities is not just to understand the dynamics of each market, but to understand how to help businesses across markets connect and work together – from the automotive sector in Thailand and electronic manufacturing in Malaysia to natural resources in Indonesia and pharmaceutical and financial services in Singapore. — The Jakarta Post/ANN

Because of this, the core national interest of the United;"As Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger puts it, microchips are the new oil—and will be more important than oil and gas over the next five decades. Because of this, the core national interest of the United States is to maintain technological superiority by denying China the opportunity to catch up in microchip technology. Two columns ago, I looked into how this manifests in a growing US-led alliance. In my previous column, I then added a related topic: the ongoing competition between the US and China over submarine cables, with both nations fiercely competing to leverage their diplomatic and commercial power to make countries choose sides.

Today, we look at data centers. In previous years, Singapore's reign had been challenged by Indonesia. The Philippines is now seeking to compete, with PLDT, SpaceDC, the Threadborne Group, YCO Cloud Centers, Beeinfotech, and Globe Telecom, Dito Telecommunity, and Converge ICT engaging with foreign partners. What has helped make data centers increasingly attractive domestically is increased cable capacity as funds originally earmarked for China are diverted to places like the Philippines, as well as a favorable policy environment, a growing domestic market and global-ready workforce, translating to a compound annual growth rate of 11.2 percent from 2022-2027.

Investments from the US and EU lack the wallop of full state support. The Digital Silk Road component of the Belt and Road Initiative envisions state 'investments in telecommunications-network infrastructure, including 5G, submarine and overland fiber-optic cables, satellite ground tracking stations, data centers, whole-of-system integrated solutions such as ‘smart city' and security-sector information systems, and select ‘over-the-top' applications such as financial services and processes (fintech) and e-commerce investments.' Untroubled by elections or even, to a large extent, public opinion, China has been able to focus its energies on long-term planning and swift execution.

The battle began over a decade ago. In 2014, Xi Jinping declared that 'The flow of information guides the flow of technology, capital, and talent,' and that the amount of information controlled has become an important indicator of a nation's soft power and competitiveness.

Both nations, China and the US, are using their laws to foster their national security. China's rests on twin planks: a personal information protection law modeled on the EU's regulations, and a data security law. According to a commentary by Reva Goujon: 'Beijing's philosophy on data sovereignty rests on several principles: data localization requirements, state oversight and restrictions on cross-border data flows, the right to force transfers of source code, the protection of personal data, and the state's right to sweeping surveillance powers.'

For its part, as we've seen, the US is enforcing an advanced microchip blockade on China, refusing to give landing rights to cables that directly connect to China, and maintains a Bureau of Industry and Security Unverified List which 'subjects foreign firms to strict licensing requirements' as an antidote to China laws requiring companies to share data with the state.

The flow of data itself also brings up national security. Last year, Aynne Kokas' 'Trafficking Data: How China Is Winning the Battle for Digital Sovereignty' was published by Oxford, arguing that a failure of US political leadership, the mania for disruption of Silicon Valley, and Wall Street's seeking growth at all costs fueled China's remarkable accumulation of wealth through technology—with Chinese firms quietly mining the US for data to send home. This year's latest buzzword—artificial intelligence—is leading governments to consider (and act) on its implications. The West is tackling concerns piecemeal; China is taking a much more integrated approach.

A study by our own National Defense College also points out the fourth dimension of the China-US competition: actual military use of cyberspace. Here, China was advanced; for over two decades now, I have been referring to how, in 1996, Wei Jincheng published an article, 'Information War: A New Form of People's War' in the Liberation Army Daily of the People's Republic of China, and how this thinking has been implemented over the years from internet espionage, to online brigades to trolls, to the 'great firewall of China' and now the Digital Silk Road. Theory has been accompanied by practice: China mobilized hackers as far back as 1999 in revenge for the accidental bombing by Nato of its embassy in Belgrade; in 2007, China demonstrated its capacity to destroy satellites in space and Russia did so in 2021 (China is also building the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System to rival GPS).";inquirer.net;1957;news;PH;en;Manuel L.

US President Joe Biden will unveil the plans, flanked by other Group of Seven leaders, some of whom have already unveiled their own separate initiatives, at their annual gathering being held this year at Schloss Elmau in southern Germany.

Increasingly worried about China, G7 leaders first floated plans for the project last year, and are formally launching it now under a fresh title, 'Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment' while dropping the moniker 'Build Back Better World' first coined by Biden during his presidential campaign.

Biden will unveil several specific projects at a G7 side event, joined by leaders from Britain, Germany, Japan, the European Union, and Canada, vowing to focus on projects that help tackle climate change as well as improve global health, gender equity, and digital infrastructure. Notably absent will be French President Emmanual Macron who had formally joined the Chinese infrastructure program.

'The president's not thinking that we need to spend dollar for dollar versus China … though if you add up what the US and the G7 partners are going to be announcing, it comes pretty close to the number,' one senior US official told reporters.

The funds would be raised through grants and federal funds, and by leveraging private-sector investments, the White House said, adding that hundreds of billions of additional dollars could come from multilateral development banks, development finance institutions, sovereign wealth funds, and others.

China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) scheme, which Chinese President Xi Jinping launched in 2013, involves development and investment initiatives in over 100 countries, with a range of projects including railways, ports, and highways.

White House officials say Xi's plan to create a modern version of the ancient Silk Road trade route has provided little tangible benefit for many developing countries, with top jobs going to Chinese workers while increasing rates of forced and child labor.

Biden will highlight several flagship projects, including a $2 billion solar development project in Angola with support from the Commerce Department, the US Export-Import Bank, US firm AfricaGlobal Schaffer, and US project developer Sun Africa.

Together with G7 members and the EU, Washington will also provide $3.3 million in technical assistance to Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal as it develops an industrial-scale flexible multi-vaccine manufacturing facility in that country that can eventually produce COVID-19 and other vaccines.

The US Agency for International Development (USAID) will also commit up to $50 million over five years to the World Bank's new global Childcare Incentive Fund, a project aimed at addressing the gap in suitable childcare infrastructure.

U.S. President Joe Biden and other G7 leaders relaunched the newly renamed 'Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment,' at their annual gathering being held this year at Schloss Elmau in southern Germany.

Biden said the United States would mobilize $200 billion in grants, federal funds and private investment over five years to support projects in low- and middle-income countries that help tackle climate change as well as improve global health, gender equity and digital infrastructure.

'I want to be clear. This isn't aid or charity. It's an investment that will deliver returns for everyone,' Biden said, adding that it would allow countries to 'see the concrete benefits of partnering with democracies.'

Biden said hundreds of billions of additional dollars could come from multilateral development banks, development finance institutions, sovereign wealth funds and others.

Europe will mobilize 300 billion euros for the initiative over the same period to build up a sustainable alternative to China's Belt and Road Initiative scheme, which Chinese President Xi Jinping launched in 2013, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the gathering.

The leaders of Italy, Canada and Japan also spoke about their plans, some of which have already been announced separately. French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson were not present, but their countries are also participating.

China's investment scheme involves development and programs in over 100 countries aimed at creating a modern version of the ancient Silk Road trade route from Asia to Europe.

White House officials said the plan has provided little tangible benefit for many developing countries.

Biden highlighted several flagship projects, including a $2 billion solar development project in Angola with support from the Commerce Department, the U.S. Export-Import Bank, U.S. firm AfricaGlobal Schaffer, and U.S. project developer Sun Africa.

Together with G7 members and the EU, Washington will also provide $3.3 million in technical assistance to Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal as it develops an industrial-scale flexible multi-vaccine manufacturing facility in that country that can eventually produce COVID-19 and other vaccines, a project that also involves the EU.

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) will also commit up to $50 million over five years to the World Bank's global Childcare Incentive Fund.

Friederike Roder, vice president of the non-profit group Global Citizen, said the pledges of investment could be 'a good start' toward greater engagement by G7 countries in developing nations and could underpin stronger global growth for all.

G7 countries on average provide only 0.32% of their gross national income, less than half of the 0.7% promised, in development assistance, she said.

'But without developing countries, there will be no sustainable recovery of the world economy,' she said.

The G7, whose leaders are meeting in southwestern England, has been searching for a coherent response to the growing assertiveness of Xi after China's surging economic and military rise over the past 40 years.

U.S. President Joe Biden and other G7 leaders hope their plan, known as the Build Back Better World (B3W) initiative, will provide a transparent infrastructure partnership to help narrow the $40 trillion needed by developing nations by 2035, the White House said.

'This is not just about confronting or taking on China,' a senior official in Biden's administration said. 'But until now we haven't offered a positive alternative that reflects our values, our standards and our way of doing business.'

The United States later said there was a G7 consensus on the need for a shared approach to China on trade and human rights.

The G7 and its allies will use the B3W initiative to mobilise private-sector capital in areas such as climate, health and health security, digital technology, and gender equity and equality, the White House added.

It was not immediately clear how exactly the plan would work or how much capital it would ultimately allocate.

China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) scheme, which Xi launched in 2013, involves development and investment initiatives that would stretch from Asia to Europe and beyond.

More than 100 countries have signed agreements with China to cooperate in BRI projects like railways, ports, highways and other infrastructure.

Critics say Xi's plan to create a modern version of the ancient Silk Road trade route to link China with Asia, Europe and beyond is a vehicle for the expansion of Communist China. Beijing says such doubts betray the 'imperial hangover' of many Western powers that humiliated China for centuries.

CHINA'S RISE

Leaders of the G7 – the United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, Italy, France and Japan – want to use their gathering in the seaside resort of Carbis Bay to show the world that the richest democracies can offer an alternative to China's growing clout.

The re-emergence of China as a leading global power is considered to be one of the most significant geopolitical events of recent times, alongside the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union that ended the Cold War.

China in 1979 had an economy that was smaller than Italy's, but after opening to foreign investment and introducing market reforms, it has become the world's second-largest economy and is a global leader in a range of new technologies.

The U.S. official said until now, the West had failed to offer a positive alternative to the 'lack of transparency, poor environmental and labour standards, and coercive approach' of the Chinese government that had left many countries worse off.

According to a Refinitiv database, as of mid-last year, more than 2,600 projects at a cost of $3.7 trillion were linked to the BRI, although the Chinese foreign ministry said last June that about 20% of projects had been seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

As part of the G7 plan, the United States will work with the U.S. Congress to supplement existing development financing and to 'collectively catalyze hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investment', the White House said.

CRITICISM OVER CAMPS

Biden made 'forceful comments' to G7 leaders about the need to make a strong statement on Washington and rights group say is the use of forced labour in China, but there was a 'spectrum of how far different countries are willing to go' in their criticism in a final communique from the three-day summit, another U.S. official said.

The U.S. official later said the G7 had reached consensus on the need for a shared approach on 'non-market economic practices' and on human rights abuses, and to coordinate on supply-chain resilience.

The United States has pushed for specific language in the communique about alleged forced labour in the China's Xinjiang region, officials said.

U.N. experts and rights groups estimate over a million people, mainly Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, have been detained in recent years in a vast system of camps in Xinjiang.

China denies all accusations of forced labour or abuse. It initially denied the camps existed, but has since said they are vocational centres and are designed to combat extremism. In late 2019, China said all people in the camps had 'graduated'.

The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

71;Underwater cable contest;Manuel L. Quezon III;2023-05-10 12:30:00;timezone unknown;https://opinion.inquirer.net/163033/underwater-cable-contest;inquirer.net;"Early in February, the island of Matsu's two cables linking it to Taiwan were cut: first by a fishing vessel, then by a cargo ship.

The island is the closest outpost of Taiwan to the Chinese";"Early in February, the island of Matsu's two cables linking it to Taiwan were cut: first by a fishing vessel, then by a cargo ship.

The island is the closest outpost of Taiwan to the Chinese mainland. Excused as 'accidents,' the incidents coincided with increasing tensions as the rhetoric emanating from Beijing against Taipei and Washington escalated and underlined the vulnerability of global internet traffic to disruption.

This has been an increasing source of concern since January 2022, when the Svalbard Undersea Cable System which links mainland Norway and the Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic Ocean was cut: Suspicions fell on Russia, which had been complaining that a Svalbard-based satellite facility was tracking its submarines. The incident reminded observers of a 2014 action by Russia preceding its annexation of Crimea when it damaged cables connecting the area to the rest of Ukraine.

We ourselves are no strangers to the disruption cut undersea cables can cause, in war and peace. We have been connected to the world by undersea cables since the first one connecting us to Hong Kong was laid in 1880. After Commodore George Dewey sank the Spanish fleet at Manila Bay, in 1898, the Spanish governor general refused to allow the Americans use of the cable to Hong Kong; so Dewey cut it, sending a revenue cutter to carry dispatches to and from Hong Kong; later on, he cut the cable to Capiz, isolating Manila from the rest of the archipelago.

Back in 2006, the vulnerabilities of the undersea cable system were demonstrated when a massive earthquake off Taiwan affected over 120 call centers: They were totally cut off from their clients on the day of the earthquake, with capacity still down by 40 percent three days after the quake. Most recently in 2010, 'terrorists also cut cable lines near Cagayan de Oro,' according to the Maritime Awareness Project.

Back in 2006, all our internet systems connect to the outside world from a single point, somewhere in the vicinity of Batangas. Since then, the number of cables has increased, not least because, as relations between America and China soured, funds were diverted to beef up the networks with friendlier countries, including the Philippines. Submarine Networks says that 'today 11 in-service international submarine cable systems connecting the Philippines, and another six transpacific and intra-Asia subsea cables under construction,' adding that, 'By 2024, there will be seven trans-pacific subsea cables connecting the Philippines to the US.' Last week, we looked at the rivalry between the United States and China—involving the American-led effort to deny China advanced microchip technology and capacity—is also manifesting itself in another rivalry forcing nations to take sides. Here is a revealing case. The Pacific Light Cable Network began as a Chinese majority-owned submarine cable system initially designed to connect Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines, and the US. PLDC (Pacific Light Data Communication) also had two major American partners: Google and Meta (formerly Facebook). In 2020, Team Telecom of the US Department of Justice recommended disapproval of its undersea cable connection to the US. So Google and Facebook refiled their application to connect Taiwan and the Philippines to the US, abandoning the Hong Kong portion, and 'without ownership and control by a Chinese entity.' By January 2022, this was approved and in February, the Dr. Peng Telecom Media Group, a Chinese stakeholder in PLDC, sold its stake at a loss, replaced by a Canadian investor.

There were other repercussions to the Team Telecom announcement. Between September 2020 and March 2021, three trans-pacific cables projects to Hong Kong withdrew their US landing applications, while two new cable projects: Bifrost (with Facebook, Keppel, Telin as partners) connecting the US west coast, to Guam, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Echo (Facebook, Google as partners) connecting the US west coast, Guam, Singapore, Indonesia, were announced.

For its part, China has been withholding cooperation on undersea cables. Last February, it left South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 6 (or Sea-Me-We 6) consortium; instead, China Telecommunications Corp. (China Telecom), China Mobile Limited, and China United Network Communications Group Co. Ltd. (China Unicom) announced a Europe-Middle East-Asia undersea cable project to link Hong Kong to Hainan, 'before snaking its way to Singapore, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and France,' Reuters reported last month. HMN Technologies, (majority owned by Huawei Technologies) would make and lay down, the cable, with industry analysts saying this might prevent 'some parts of the world' from purchasing capacity in the cable because of this. Reuters had already declared last March that the US and China were waging war beneath the waves.

The year before, China Telecom and China Mobile, which had a combined stake of 20 percent, withdrew from a project linking Asia with Europe when a US company was contracted to build it. The US for its part has rejected 'several' cable projects that either involved Chinese companies or directly connected mainland China or Hong Kong to the US on national security grounds. (Chinese law requires their businesses and organizations to share data with the government when national security is invoked.)

China includes undersea cables in the Digital Silk Road portion of its Road and Belt Initiative. This strategic vision is what makes otherwise odd schemes, such as Chinese interest in building a 'smart city' (and other proposals like an industrial park and an airport expansion) on remote Fuga Island, which is administratively part of Aparri, make sense. A Guardian article recently reported that our military, alarmed, decided to establish a naval base there instead; now there is talk of its possible use as an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement site. Fuga is in the Bashi Channel which separates us from Taiwan, and which, in fact, remains disputed between Taiwan and the Philippines since the 1930s, and where China has been sending its air force to do exercises over the channel.

Five days ago, Biz Buzz pointed to Boracay where Dennis Uy had packaged a 2018 deal in which KT Corp. of Korea put up public Wi-Fi in parts of the island, throwing in 40 CCTV cameras for the use of the local government. The system was meant to use the (then nonexistent) infrastructure of Uy's Converge ICT, which is finally in place. I've followed Uy's zigzagging efforts and China Telecom's frustrated efforts to come in as the third player in our telecoms, for years in this space.

Converge is a partner (with China Mobile International Limited, China Unicom Global, PPTEL SEA H2X Sdn. Bhd., HMN Technologies Co. Ltd.) in a submarine cable project to link the Philippines, Hong Kong, China, Thailand, East Malaysia, and Singapore by 2024 called South East Asia Hainan-Hong Kong Express Cable System (SEA-H2X). This contrasts with it merely buying access to Keppel Telecommunications and Transportation's Bifrost Cable System connecting Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines, to the US West Coast. Last February, construction of the landing station for this cable was begun in Davao City.

The same Biz Buzz article mentioned that Dennis Uy is getting into the data center game, with a 'big' one to rise in Parañaque with a 'multinational player' holding a 40 percent stake. But this is another fast-growing, strategic arena of competition between China and the US.

His telecoms firm, Dito, in turn, is part of a consortium with Globe Telecoms, to build the Asia Link Cable connecting Hong Kong and Singapore as its trunk and branches to the Philippines, Brunei Darussalam, and Hainan in mainland China by 2025. But as we've seen, the dividing line moving forward, cable-wise, is Chinese participation.";inquirer.net;1957;news;PH;en;Manuel L.

Its members -- the 10 Asean nations plus Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea -- represent a very diverse mix, with varying interests and priorities.It is significant to note that China, Japan and South Korea have signed a single trade agreement together for the very first time. It would otherwise have been an arduous task for the three countries to negotiate a pact among themselves. It took more than 30 negotiating sessions to bring to fruition the biggest free trade agreement (FTA) ever signed, covering 30% of the world's gross domestic product and population. Participants believe the deal will be as ""comprehensive"" as its name claims, by increasing market access and removing tariffs on approximately 90% of goods traded, attracting more trade in the process, and advancing investment opportunities in Asia Pacific. It will also be a spur for greater economic integration in the region. The RCEP will allow businesses to trade with any country in the 15-nation group, without having to adhere to different individual requirements of each country. This will greatly decrease trading and transaction costs, and time spent, and improve supply chain management. For example, there is only a single rule of origin framework to adhere to, which will deal with all the RCEP member states. This should lead to a faster and greater flow of goods between the countries. We could also see an increase in manufacturing activities and capabilities as manufacturers can operate in countries with lower labour costs. A study done by the Brookings Institution predicts that the gains from the RCEP will help offset the losses suffered by members because of the US-China trade war. The US-based think tank also predicts that by 2030, the RCEP will contribute US$500 billion to international trade. The European Union has often emphasised the importance of the Asia Pacific region as the main driver of growth in the global economy for the next few decades. Even though the EU is not part of the deal, it will lead to more trading opportunities with Asean. Since the different rules of origin descriptions will be integrated into one, this will ensure that European firms can trade their goods and services in Asean with greater ease, and enjoy reduced costs at the same time. European firms can then pass on these cost savings to consumers. The RCEP is the first multilateral trade agreement that China has ever signed, and is a momentous geopolitical victory for Beijing. It is crucial for consolidating the superpower's influence and soft power in Asia Pacific, especially in Southeast Asia, which will now be integrated more closely with China's economic sphere. According to the Singapore-based bank DBS, from 2015-19, China was the third biggest source of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Southeast Asia, as it stepped up its Belt & Road and Digital Silk Road initiatives. As an RCEP member, China will be encouraged to increase FDI in Asean. As well, consumer goods from China will become more competitive in countries such as Japan as tariffs are reduced. Americans should be concerned that the RCEP has gone ahead without the US. The Trump administration's protectionist stance and America's withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership have led to reduced US involvement in economic cooperation globally, especially in Asia. To some extent, America has failed to counter China's influence in the region. Nevertheless, President-elect Joe Biden is likely to prioritise Asean and Asia Pacific, and will look to expand America's influence and involvement in economic partnerships. It is also worth noting the absence of India, which withdrew from the RCEP amid fears that it would pose a credible threat to the profits of domestic farmers and producers. However, members remain receptive to India joining the RCEP in the future. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang believes the agreement further promotes the values and importance of free trade and multilateralism, at a time when nationalistic sentiment and protectionism have grown in the West. Experts believe the RCEP will push investment and trade in Asia Pacific to new heights over the next few decades. The region will also be a more systematic and orderly trading area, similar to Europe and North America.

73;Year in review: The winners and losers of 2020;;2021-01-05 12:18:35;full;https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/2045171/year-in-review-the-winners-and-losers-of-2020;bangkokpost.com;As 2021 begins -- not soon enough for most of us -- we take one last look at the year that was.;"As 2021 begins -- not soon enough for most of us -- we take one last look at the year that was. For Thailand, 2020 was a year of turmoil, disruption and contrasts. Simmering discontent boiled over for some in the form of protests, and the coronavirus pandemic impacted all. The nation escaped the horrific numbers of Covid-19 deaths seen by other countries, but the economy was not spared. The resurgence of coronavirus deepens economic gloom. Worst year: Asia's Poorest As in too many places, it is the poorest and most vulnerable in Asia -- the forgotten men, women and children, of the region -- who have been hit hardest by Covid-19. The World Bank reports that Asia's most vulnerable have borne the brunt of a ""triple shock"" -- the pandemic itself, the economic fallout from the containment measures, and the ensuing global recession. In Thailand and elsewhere in Southeast Asia, migrant workers in particular have suffered the consequences of economic lockdowns. The diversity of victims of the coronavirus's economic impact has ranged from seafood workers from Myanmar in Thailand's seafood industry to medical glove factory workers from Nepal in Malaysia. Amid collapsing tourism and weakened exports, hunger grows, and access to jobs, technology and education shrinks. The Asian Development Bank now projects that the coronavirus could push 160 million more into poverty across Asia. The region's poverty rate will increase for the first time in 20 years, says the World Bank. And so sadly, it is Asia's rapidly growing class of the ""new Covid poor"" who receive the depressing distinction of the worst year in Asia. Bad year: WHO and Ghebreyesus It should have been a year for the WHO to shine. Instead, the specialised UN health agency and its beleaguered director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia, found themselves in a no-win situation facing accusations of not holding China accountable for its less than transparent handling of the coronavirus. Hidebound by the rules of bureaucracy and diplomacy, the WHO could say little as China delayed release of information, allowed millions to travel from Wuhan during the Chinese New Year period, and cracked down on citizen journalists and whistleblowers. In February, Chinese doctor Li Wenliang himself died from Covid-19 after seeking to warn others of a mysterious Sars-like virus early on. President Trump said the US -- the WHO's largest donor--would leave the organisation, alleging that Dr Ghebreyesus and the WHO were beholden to China. A turnaround could be at hand with a new US Administration, but it's been a decidedly bad year for WHO and Dr Ghebreyesus. Mixed year: Xi and Belt and Road China President Xi Jinping's successes at home so far in crushing Covid-19 and dissent in Hong Kong were tempered by growing pushback abroad in 2020 against his much-touted ""Belt and Road Initiative"". This grand ""One Belt One Road"" infrastructure scheme launched in 2013 to connect some 70 countries with a ""new Silk Road"" of Chinese-financed ports, railways and highways, and other projects ran into growing push back amid Covid-19 slowdowns and worries about debt owed to China. This was underscored at year-end as Australia approved new laws that would give Prime Minister Scott Morrison powers to veto or scrap agreements that state governments reach with foreign countries, including a BRI project in the state of Victoria. A 2020 Pew Research survey fielded in 14 countries including Australia, the US and several Asian and European nations revealed that attitudes toward Xi and China have now reached new lows. 78% of respondents stated that they had little or no confidence Mr Xi would do the right thing in global affairs, up from 61% in 2019. Yes, 2020 was a decidedly mixed year for Mr Xi despite, or perhaps because of, the reality of China's engagement abroad -- from conflict on the Himalayan border with India to trade tensions and disputes over the Mekong River and the South China Sea. Good year: Asia's e-commerce The United States might have Amazon, and Thai consumers know Lazada and Shopee, but a diversity of Asia's e-commerce giants also found 2020 to be an emphatically good year. E-commerce in Asia was already on the rise well before Covid-19. GoJek of Indonesia and Grab of Singapore have long had well established digital payment platforms. And with the pandemic, the pace of adoption has quickened as lockdowns drove more consumers from India to Japan online. Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com racked up a record US$115 billion (3.4 trillion baht) in sales on a single day. And a report from Google, Temasek Holdings and Bain & Company projects e-commerce in Southeast Asia to exceed $100 billion by 2025, up from $38 billion in 2019. All this is good news across Asia for e-commerce platforms such as Tokopedia, Taobao, Shopify, Bukalapak and Sendo. Importantly, it might also herald many a good year ahead as consumers build on new digital habits, from fintech to telemedicine. Great year: Tsai and Ardern Both women won landslide re-election this year, but that's not all that Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern have in common. These two leaders led charges against Covid-19, instituting strict lockdown measures that prevented community transmission in their countries while also avoiding the draconian practices adopted by China. In mid-December, Taiwan with a population of about 24 million had reported just 759 cases and seven deaths. New Zealand with a population of about 5 million had recorded 2110 cases and 25 deaths. Ms Arden has also remained unruffled during a live telecast in the midst of an earthquake, and continues to lead her nation forward amid enduring climate change and terrorism worries. And when it comes to economic numbers, Ms Tsai and the people and businesses of Taiwan may well be a role model for all. A campaign proclaiming ""Taiwan can help"" has sought to turn the island's success in battling Covid-19 into geopolitical gains. By mid-December, Taiwan's 2020 economic growth looked to outpace much of Asia's including that of mainland China -- the world's second-largest economy -- for the first time in decades. So, in this most difficult of years, the ""Best Year in Asia"" gong goes to a dynamic duo of decisive female leaders who are showing the way to a better year ahead.";bangkokpost.com;2214;news;TH;en;[];https://static.bangkokpost.com/newdesign/assets/images/bg/opinion/images_opinion_editorial_1.jpg?v=0.1;True;;17.567574;78a079631b69ab72820a0d78c84a3aa4;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

At the same press briefing, Wang Xiaolong, director-general at the Foreign Ministry's International Economic Affairs Department, also revealed that a survey by the ministry estimated that some 30 to 40 percent of projects had been somewhat affected, while approximately 40 percent of projects were deemed to have seen little adverse impact. Even before COVID-19, the BRI was facing increasing criticism in host countries for its lack of transparency, displacement of local communities, adverse environmental impacts and fears of 'debt-trap diplomacy,' among many other issues. With the pandemic inevitably delaying many of BRI's physical infrastructure projects, will COVID-19 be a nail in the coffin or a turning point for the BRI?According to the American Enterprise Institute's China Global Investment Tracker, the value of both Chinese investment and construction fell sharply in 2020 compared to 2019. On the Chinese side, the decline in funding can be attributed to a more cautious approach by Chinese banks toward disbursing unsustainable loans. The restricted movement of labor and goods caused by the border controls imposed by many countries in response to COVID-19 has also inflicted a significant toll in the construction of physical infrastructure projects.While the COVID-19 situation has improved significantly within China itself, the situation remains bleak in many of the countries hosting BRI projects, from Africa to Southeast Asia. In addition, the global economic slowdown brought on by the pandemic has also increased the likelihood of host countries cancelling or delaying BRI projects, especially large-scale infrastructure projects. In March, Bangladesh announced the cancellation of a 350-megawatt coal-fired thermal plant project.NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter Many BRI projects have previously been criticized for a lack of transparency and unfair loan conditions; the pandemic has worked to deepen many of these worries. More importantly, many host countries are now voicing these concerns and displeasure toward Beijing. Since COVID-19 hit, many governments have approached Beijing to renegotiate the terms of loans for BRI projects. For example, Pakistan in April requested an ease in the repayment terms for over $30 billion in loans associated with various power projects under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Undoubtedly, COVID-19 has raised serious questions with regard to the future of Xi Jinping's grand initiative. Notwithstanding the existing criticisms and mistrust toward Chinese intentions for the BRI, it is unlikely that a BRI focused on physical infrastructure construction and connectivity will be able to return to its former scale and glory, at least within the short and medium term, as China grapples with increasing debt defaults and project delays as a result of the pandemic.Nevertheless, COVID-19 need not be the nail in the coffin for the BRI. It could also be an opportunity for Beijing for rethink the strategy and focus of the BRI, or order to better meet the needs of a post COVID-19 world.Even before the pandemic hit, China had already begun to expand the BRI beyond physical infrastructure projects. In 2015, China launched the Digital Silk Road, focused on the development of information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure in BRI markets. Last year, China announced 5G investments in various countries, including Cambodia and Russia. AdvertisementAt the first BRI forum in 2017, China, along with participating countries and various international organizations, issued the Beijing Communique of the Belt and Road Health Cooperation and Health Silk Road. Since then, China has initiated several regional health cooperation projects with its neighbors, including the China–ASEAN Human Resources Training Program of Health Silk Road, which aims to train more than 1,000 ASEAN healthcare professionals by 2022.Just as COVID-19 has brought to light the insufficiencies in global healthcare and ICT infrastructure, especially within developing countries, it also provides an opportunity for China to fill these gaps through its Health Silk Road and Digital Silk Road. COVID-19 thus presents both a challenge and an opportunity for the BRI.Redirecting the BRI to focus on soft infrastructure projects in the digital and health sectors could help rejuvenate interest in the BRI in a post-COVID-19 world. Investments in such projects could also provide an opportunity for China to expand its soft power and shape its image as a responsible great power.However, just as the traditional BRI is susceptible to criticisms and suspicion of other countries, the Health Silk Road and Digital Silk Road are likewise open to criticism, as evident from the growing pushback against the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei in many Western countries. The trust and confidence of host countries in China's push to accelerate the Health Silk Road and Digital Silk Road will be directly dependent on China's ability to avoid mixing geopolitical rivalries with upcoming BRI projects. Lee YingHui is an associate research fellow with the Maritime Security Programme at the S.

76;Is China Stacking the Technology Deck by Setting International Standards?;;2021-12-02 01:45:00;timezone unknown;https://thediplomat.com/2021/12/is-china-stacking-the-technology-deck-by-setting-international-standards/;thediplomat.com;Though often overshadowed by China's advances in technology, the state-directed strategy to set technological standards will have a lasting impact.;"AdvertisementChinese President Xi Jinping's avowed intent to make China a 'cyber great power' is not to be taken lightly. Early in his tenure, Xi announced his determination to enable Chinese indigenous technology to 'catch up and surpass' the West. Since then, international attention has focused on China's rapid advance in cutting-edge technologies such as AI, quantum computing, 5G networks, the Internet of Things, new materials, and synthetic biology, to name a few. But what seems to go largely unnoticed is a state-directed two-track strategy to gain a strategic and structural advantage by setting international technology standards.The first of these tracks is a deliberate push to gain influence in the international technical standards-setting bodies (also known as standards developing organizations, or SDOs). These bodies can be either multilateral organizations made up of government representatives or multistakeholder bodies where industry and technical experts can participate. In both types of SDOs, the Xi administration has quietly worked to place Chinese nationals in key leadership positions, to chair important technical committees and working groups, and to get Chinese companies to vote as a bloc on Chinese proposals.The process for negotiating and approving technical standards was developed primarily by the historical leaders in technology – the United States and Europe – as a process largely led by industry. They operated on the principle that the process should be an open, bottom-up, private sector-led model. For the Chinese government, however, technical standard-setting is a key element of a national strategy to promote international norms that favor Beijing's interests. Chinese industry operates in SDOs under guidelines set by the state to advance nationally defined objectives. These goals are not only commercial but strategic as well, such as Beijing's concept of 'cyber sovereignty' – the push to erect national boundaries in cyberspace that block the free flow of information.A second track in Beijing's strategy to gain advantage through international technology standard-setting runs along the Belt and Road – specifically, its 'Digital Silk Road.' Beijing is utilizing Digital Silk Road projects to set de facto standards from the ground up through the export of its technologies. Taking a page from Western companies, these exports are creating 'path dependencies' that essentially lock customers into using Chinese technology by making it difficult and expensive to switch to an alternative product with different specifications. Beijing is going further by signing agreements with governments along the Digital Silk Road for the harmonization of standards, funding local standards certification centers, and translating Chinese-developed standards into local languages.Another feature of the Digital Silk Road is the export of bundled or stacked technology packages – think 'Smart Cities' systems – which automate municipal functions and can include facial recognition systems, big data analysis, 5G telecoms, and AI sensors. Since these are emerging technologies for which standards remain largely up for grabs, the spread of Smart Cities is a plus for China's standard-setting drive. China can point to wide-spread adoption of its technologies as indicators of a high-quality standard, which bolsters Chinese companies' case in international standards negotiations and boosts the marketability of their products.Enjoying this article?

The export of Chinese surveillance and censorship technology provides authoritarian governments with new tools of repression. Governments that seek to control their citizens' access to the internet are supportive of Beijing's 'cyber sovereignty' paradigm, which can lead to a balkanized internet riddled with incompatibilities that impede international commerce and slow technological innovation. And when cyber sovereignty is paired with Beijing's push to redefine human rights as the 'collective' rights of society as defined by the state, authoritarian governments gain a shield of impunity for violations of universal norms.For Western countries to compete effectively with Beijing's two-track approach to technological standards-setting they must first determine, in consultation with industry, what their priorities should be. Technologies and standards are not all equal, and resources are not infinite. So, the place to begin is selecting strategically important emerging technologies, assessing the types of technical standards relevant to them, and determining where and how these standards will be established. Government-industry and government-to-government coordination is essential for both prioritization and for effective action in global SDOs.NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
The U.S. government would do well to develop an interagency strategy on global internet governance, reflecting imperatives for U.S. national security and competitiveness, which would inform and reflect priorities for standardization. This could include the designation of a single U.S. government coordinator responsible for outreach and liaison with industry, civil society, and technical experts. Increased funding for standards-relevant agencies and support for increased agency and private-sector participation in SDOs would be helpful, as would incentives for creating the next generation of technology standards professionals.AdvertisementInternet governance could be an important component of collaborative initiatives in groups like the Quad and the G7. This could begin with encouraging active and coordinated participation in SDOs, including competition for leadership positions, and discouraging unique national standards among partner countries.It is appropriate for China to play a role in shaping tech governance commensurate with its growing status as a technology leader. As China expands its influence through the Digital Silk Road and in SDOs, its ability to shape global technical standards is set to increase. Given the importance of those standards in terms of economic competitiveness, national security, and to the freedoms rooted in an open internet, it is time for the United States and its partners to up their game.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;[];https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2021-09-07-7.jpg;False;;25.781998;a71bec3d38f2d8c1d40a798b08c2e563;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}
77;China Is Weaponizing the Belt and Road. What Can the US Do About It?;;2020-10-22 10:00:00;timezone unknown;https://thediplomat.com/2020/10/china-is-weaponizing-the-belt-and-road-what-can-the-us-do-about-it/;thediplomat.com;The BRI-driven trend toward a Chinese sphere of influence is neither inevitable nor irreversible.;"AdvertisementMore than seven years have passed since Chinese President Xi Jinping unveiled the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013. What began as the Silk Road Economic Belt and the Maritime Silk Road has expanded into space, cyberspace and global health. In the terrestrial and maritime domains, BRI now includes multiple deep-sea ports in strategic proximity to vital sea lanes and maritime chokepoints. The fact that a number of BRI port projects in the Indo-Pacific do not appear commercially viable raises questions about Beijing's motives for investing in these infrastructure assets.The Chinese government's steadfast insistence that the BRI is purely a peaceful, 'win-win' development initiative has been met with skepticism in many quarters. The rapid pace of China's military modernization, its program of civil-military fusion and its increasingly assertive posture throughout the Indo-Pacific have fueled suspicion about BRI and its strategic utility to China. Along with accusations of 'debt-trap diplomacy,' some critics warn that projects like Hambantota port in Sri Lanka or Gwadar port in Pakistan are part of a 'String of Pearls' network of potential naval bases along the shores of the Indian Ocean.It is certainly true that the maritime domain is critical to China's economic development and security. Since 40 percent of China's gross domestic product is derived from foreign trade, and more than 60 percent of trade and 80 percent of China's imported oil moves by sea, it's no surprise that the People's Liberation Army Navy's (PLAN's) budget has grown significantly, or that its strategy has shifted beyond China's coastal waters toward protection of vital sea lanes and its overseas interests. The PLAN's area of operations has now expanded beyond the so-called 'second island chain,' which stretches from Japan to Guam and to Indonesia. Its first – and thus far only – overseas base in Djibouti is located at the entrance to the Bab-el-Mandeb strait leading to the Suez Canal and European markets.Along the Maritime Silk Road, BRI port projects bolster the PLAN's ability to operate further afield. BRI ports in the Indo-Pacific are not naval bases per se, but they often have dual-use commercial and military functionality. What Beijing calls 'civil-military fusion' is now codified in laws and regulations that require overseas infrastructure projects to be built to PLA military specifications and mandate that Chinese-owned businesses must support PLA operations. Labeled 'strategic strongpoints' by Chinese planners, these ports incorporate features that boost their potential military utility and expand the PLA's logistics network to facilitate power projection further from China's shores.But to look at these 'strategic strongpoints' in isolation is to miss the real danger, which is that they are components of a suite of infrastructure, economic and other assets being assembled by Beijing that serve as platforms for influence and leverage in BRI host states. That includes the Digital Silk Road, with Huawei networks and 'Smart Cities' surveillance technologies. It also includes the 'BRI Space Information Corridor,' with the Beidou satellite system. And the BRI's terrestrial, maritime, digital and space elements are combined with financial and trade ties, active diplomacy and rapidly expanding Chinese military engagement and arms sales throughout the Indo-Pacific region. As 'Weaponizing the Belt and Road Initiative,' a recent Asia Society report by one of the authors, points out, these trends are contributing to the emergence of a Sinocentric ecosystem that will do far more to hamper the United States' ability to operate effectively in the region than Chinese military bases ever would.Enjoying this article?

The U.S. and its partners can compete and out-compete China – not in a race to build infrastructure, but through a consistent, coherent, credible, comprehensive and collaborative U.S. strategy toward the Indo-Pacific.First and foremost, it's imperative that U.S. close the gulf between the rhetoric of the Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy on the one hand and its implementation and funding on the other. On the military front, this includes enhanced military diplomacy and bolstering military-to-military ties with concerned states. Tried and tested policies such as international military education and training pay long-term dividends. More urgently, on the political, economic and technological side, it means policies and programs that are seen as more than just China-bashing – that take other partners' legitimate interests into account and that inspire renewed confidence in American commitment and capability.NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
To be successful in the competition for influence with China, the U.S. needs to adequately fund the U.S. international affairs and development agencies and programs that are foundational to America's diplomatic reach and its soft/smart power. Bolstering U.S. influence requires robust investment in people-to-people ties, including through exchange programs and other initiatives. And in addition to strengthening alliances and ad hoc partnerships such as the 'Quad' with like-minded states such as Japan, Australia and India, the U.S. needs to reverse the vacuum it created by deserting international forums and neglecting regional organizations such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.AdvertisementLastly, diplomacy with China itself should not be abandoned. Sustained and high-level strategic dialogue is an indispensable tool for setting limits, deterring challenges, dispelling misconceptions, building confidence, and reducing risk through crisis prevention or management.These are all tools that the United States has wielded effectively in the past and cannot afford to discard now — especially at the moment when China is 'weaponizing' the largest-scale infrastructure project the world has ever known.Adm.

78;Digital Trade Must be Central to Biden's ‘Pivot to Asia';;2021-08-10 12:15:00;timezone unknown;https://thediplomat.com/2021/08/digital-trade-must-be-central-to-bidens-pivot-to-asia;thediplomat.com;Washington's current approach to Southeast Asia underestimates China's increasing lead in digital trade and technology.;"Advertisement

On July 30, the White House released a statement announcing that U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris will pay a visit to Singapore and Vietnam this month. This makes Harris the highest-ranking Biden administration official to visit Asia and the first vice president ever to visit Hanoi. Although the White House has not specified either the exact dates or the specific agenda of the trip, it is expected to apply the final brushes of paint to Washington's approach toward Southeast Asia, essentially defining the level of ASEAN centrality in Biden's new-look 'pivot to Asia.'

Harris' visit follows a series of events – U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's recent trip to Singapore, Vietnam, and Philippines; the second Mekong-U.S Partnership ministerial meeting; and the U.S.-ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting – which have already covered defense partnerships, development support, and the regional/international challenges of COVID-19, climate change, human capital development, and the Myanmar crisis. Although the White House's statement on Harris' visit refers to these general topics of mutual interest, there are reasons to believe that this visit will deliver what previous ones failed to.

Harris' visit to Singapore and Vietnam will shed light on the United States' more active approach to the region – in particular, its focus on the digital economy and digital trade partnerships. In that case, then ASEAN will play a central role in the U.S. Asia-Pacific strategy.

Digital trade cooperation should top the agenda of Harris' visit. Indeed, if the ultimate goal is to contain Chinese influence and maintain U.S. dominance in the Asia-Pacific, then strengthening the digital economy and trade partnerships should not be overlooked.

Why should promoting digital trade partnerships be placed high on the U.S. agenda? The first immediate reason lies in the proven ineffectiveness of the U.S. conventional approach: verbally criticizing China's expansive territorial claims and conducting Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) in the South China Sea. The U.S. Navy has conducted regular FONOPs since 2013. Other allies like Australia, Japan, France ,and the United Kingdom have also occasionally joined the U.S. in these endeavors. While these efforts aim to reinforce norms of freedom of the high seas and deter Chinese aggression, they also pose a high risk of military confrontation, which is not to the benefit of any party.

It is important for the U.S. to recognize its natural disadvantage, being an ocean away, while China is ASEAN's neighbor. No matter how hard the U.S. tries, it cannot beat China in terms of its military presence in the region. That is not to say that the U.S. should stop its FONOPs altogether; they are essential to secure U.S. physical influence in the region. But FONOPs are far from enough and it is high time to consider, as one observer put it recently, 'better means.'

While the U.S. is busy pondering what those 'better means' might be, China has been working diligently to win on another front: digital trade. Through the Digital Silk Road, which dates back to 2015, China has been expanding its influence over digital infrastructure as well as selling Chinese digital standards for cyberspace. There are two key aspects to the Digital Silk Road: First, the supply of internet connections through undersea cables and internet broadband; and second, the establishment of China's BeiDou satellite navigation network as an alternative to the GPS system created by the U.S. government. If successfully implemented, the Digital Silk Road will set up a concrete base for Chinese influence over the world's communications infrastructure.

One vivid example is the effective assertion of Chinese standards over blockchain, one of the most influential digital technologies. China is currently the world leader in blockchain developments; two-thirds of blockchain-related patents are of Chinese origin. In January 2019, claiming to deter criminals' misuse of blockchain technology, the Cyberspace Administration of China passed the Regulation for Managing Blockchain Information Services. This regulation required blockchain companies to register through a 'complete certification system,' demanded users to apply with their real identities, and allowed the CAC to store data, which essentially removes the anonymity feature that lies at the core of blockchain technology.

These actions clearly demonstrate the Chinese government's appreciation of blockchain, and its intention to champion 'de-intermediarization,'rather than the 'decentralization' praised in the West. And it seems China has succeeded in promoting blockchain standards with Chinese characteristics. By October 2019, the CAC reported having certified 506 domestic companies that offer blockchain services in a diverse range of sectors, including law, e-commerce, health care, and cultural tourism. Considering that Alibaba, a champion of blockchain application with an active consumer base of up to 811 million globally, is registered with the CAC, we could already imagine the scale of Chinese blockchain standards being promoted and practiced. Meanwhile, the U.S. has yet to develop a national strategy for blockchain.

Moreover, undersea cables deliver 99 percent of the global data traffic and thus serve as the backbone of the internet. Looking at the density of submarine cables under the South China Sea, it is unquestionable that the U.S. should look to engage ASEAN partners in securing this important digital infrastructure and establishing liberal digital trade standards.

It is no longer sufficient for Washington to peripherally engage in ASEAN through the promotion and facilitation of e-commerce. It is time for the U.S. government to sketch a region-wide digital trade agenda, touching upon regulations over key digital technologies including artificial intelligence, blockchain, the internet of things, and 3D printing.

Finally, the U.S. should benefit economically from investing in digital trade in the Asia-Pacific. The region has been and will continue to be the hub of the digital boom. Asia is home to half of the world internet users. Some 94.2 percent of the population of the Asia-Pacific is covered by a 4G network, while 70.3 percent of the region's 15-to-24-year-olds used the internet in 2019. The Asia-Pacific similarly leads the pack on e-commerce sales, with projected revenues of $2.45 trillion in 2020, tripling that of North America, which clocked $749 billion in e-commerce revenues the same year. It is estimated that the Asia-Pacific region alone accounted for 63 percent of global e-commerce sales last year.

Considering the fact that Facebook, YouTube, and WhatsApp are the top three most popular social media platforms, it won't take long for the U.S. to regain its influence in the Asia-Pacific digital market, should the government truly commit to investing in the region's customer base.

If the White House considers the possibility of an Asia-Pacific free trade agreement, it must go beyond what e-commerce chapters in the existing trade agreements cover. Inter alia, such an agreement should focus on the following: First, it should cover regulations governing emerging digital technologies like AI, blockchain, the internet of things, and 3D printing. Second, it should promote investment in and management of digital infrastructure, including 5G, cloud computing, Submarine Telecommunications Cable Systems, broadband, and semiconductor supply chains.

The agreement should focus on express shipments, cross-border data transmission, data innovations, open government data, and creating a U.S. competition policy for digital markets. Finally, the agreement should aim to create a safe online environment, and to differentiate between the U.S. commitment to freedom of speech and the Chinese tendency to filter content deemed to affect 'national security.'

The recently signed Digital Economy Partnership Agreement between Singapore, Chile, and New Zealand and the Singapore-Australia Digital Economy Agreement – which have been credited for the ambitious incorporation of regulations for emerging technologies as well as for taking a flexible modular approach – could provide a good reference point for the U.S. digital trade agenda in the Asia-Pacific region.

ASEAN in general, and Singapore and Vietnam specifically, stand a good chance of becoming an essential part of a putative Digital Marshall Plan. Geographically, ASEAN sits at the heart of the Asia-Pacific, and its netizens lead the world in terms of both time spent online and social media use. Moreover, in pioneering the new generation of digital trade agreements, Singapore has laid the foundation for a U.S.-led Asia-Pacific free trade agreement.

Apart from its existing partners – New Zealand, Chile, and Australia – Singapore has been pursuing digital trade negotiations with South Korea, the U.K., and Vietnam. For its part, the U.S. has concluded a digital trade agreement with Japan. These countries, together with other digitally advanced ASEAN nations like Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines, will form a good base for future U.S. digital engagement in the Asia-Pacific.

Digital trade forms a crucial part of the Biden administration's 'pivot to Asia.' The U.S. government has described China as 'the biggest geopolitical test of this century.' At the same time the U.S. has been underestimating its competitor and overlooking investments in an area that represents one of its core strengths: advanced digital technologies. It was not until the Biden administration that concrete investments in the United States' digital potential were enacted. In February 2021, Biden signed the executive order to improve American production of semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and other cutting-edge technologies, aiming to establish a 'China-free' tech supply chain.

In June 2021, Biden and other G-7 leaders finally announced the long-waited global infrastructure alternative, Build Back Better World (B3W) Partnership, to counter Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative. The same month, the Biden administration began seeking bipartisan support for investing $100 billion in an ambitious broadband infrastructure plan aiming to close the digital divide in rural America.

Given this momentum, it seems reasonable to expect that Kamala Harris' trip will prioritize discussions on digital trade and lay the foundation for Washington's digital trade policy in the region. Developing a free-trade agreement that addresses digital concerns should not be a 'possibility,' but rather a 'must-be' action during the trip of the highest-ranking Biden administration official to Asia.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;[];https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2021-08-10-1.jpg;False;;22.296513;2bb4b2b61845ec15483fe0fe7791be15;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the region has seen an unprecedented use of digital services, such as mobile tracing, telemedicine, video/online chat, and e-commerce. China is seeking dominance in the digital transformation of the region, which will increase Southeast Asian countries' economic and technological dependencies on China, as well as potentially render them vulnerable to Chinese cyber-espionage and surveillance. These sorts of efforts could help Beijing expand its sphere of influence in the Asia-Pacific region, while simultaneously limiting U.S. influence. However, by partnering with South Korea, Washington's longtime ally and an advanced digital technology and equipment provider, the two countries could work together to counter China's digital dominance in Southeast Asia.Fifth generation or 5G mobile networks are at the forefront of Southeast Asia's digital transformation. Such networks provide faster connection speeds, low latency, and more bandwidth, making digital communication more seamless than the previous generation of networks. 5G is also revolutionary because it will enable a wide range of new digital applications, such as the internet of things, smart cities, self-driving cars, and robotic appliances. Combined with the development of artificial intelligence technologies, there is enormous potential for the digital transformation of the economies in the region. Given these prospects, many Southeast Asian telecommunication providers have already developed 5G policies and selected 5G equipment providers. Singapore aims to achieve its nationwide 5G coverage by 2025. Thailand's mobile operator, Advanced Info Service (AIS), launched its 5G service in hospitals across the country to assist with telemedicine services. Recently, Malaysia initiated a digital masterplan to accelerate its transition toward 5G technology.The leading player in the digital transformation of Southeast Asia is China. China is pursuing exports of its digital technologies and infrastructure, dubbed the 'Digital Silk Road,' which President Xi Jinping described in 2019 as a priority for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Last year, the Chinese Communist Party's leadership called for the expansion of 5G both within China and abroad as an important part of post-pandemic economic recovery, and Southeast Asia is an important part of the Digital Silk Road. China is laying fiber-optic cables in Southeast Asia. It is also exporting its mobile payment services, such as WeChat Pay and Alipay, to Internet users in the region, many of whom do not have full access to financial services.In addition, China is cooperating with Southeast Asian countries to build 'smart cities,' which employ digital technology and data to improve the quality of life. Finally, China dominates the 5G networks equipment markets in Southeast Asia, as its 5G equipment is much cheaper than its main competitors. Two Chinese firms, Huawei and ZTE, which hold almost half the global 5G equipment market share (followed by Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung), are expanding their share in Southeast Asia. Many countries in the region, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Cambodia, and Myanmar, are already using or planning to use Chinese 5G networks.China's increasing global dominance in the 5G equipment market and digital transformation of Southeast Asia will make countries in the region vulnerable to Chinese influence. If its past behavior is any indication, Beijing will try to leverage its dominance in the digital transformation of Southeast Asia to political ends. In smart cities, for example, as digital infrastructure increasingly encroaches upon daily life, controlling everything from traffic lights to self-driving cars and checkouts at stores, China could threaten network shutdowns with disastrous consequences in countries that do not accede to its demands.Enjoying this article?

In the wake of the deployment of the U.S.' THAAD missile defense system on South Korean soil in 2016, China punished South Korea by shutting down the latter's retail stores located in China, banning tour groups from visiting South Korea, and removing South Korean TV shows from the Chinese internet. Likewise, after Australia called for an independent investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, China sanctioned Australia's wine industry. Countries that depend upon Chinese digital infrastructure will be even more vulnerable to China's bullying.In addition, China's digital dominance will make countries in the region vulnerable to China's cyber espionage and surveillance. Experts have warned that Chinese manufacturers have built back door vulnerabilities into network equipment in order to infiltrate foreign companies and enable espionage. China's Cyber Security Law and National Intelligence Law obligate all Chinese organizations and citizens to support China's national intelligence activities, and so there is little distinction between the Chinese government and private industry when it comes to cybersecurity. The head of Huawei previously served as an engineer in the People's Liberation Army, and an employee of the company was arrested in Poland in 2019 on charges of spying, adding to these concerns. Cyberattacks are another worry. Chinese hackers have reportedly planted malicious code in critical foreign infrastructure that can be activated during a potential conflict.NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
As these countries become more dependent on China economically and technologically, as well as more susceptible to China's cyberattacks and surveillance, China's influence over the region will only grow vis-à-vis that of the United States. Over time, Southeast Asian countries will be pressured to refrain from cooperating with Washington in the security realm, undermining U.S. power projection capabilities in the region. This will help China realize its ambition to expand its sphere of influence in the Asia-Pacific free from U.S. interference, endangering U.S. interests and those of its allies and partners in the region.AdvertisementWashington has pressured its partners in Southeast Asia to avoid 5G equipment made by Huawei and ZTE. However, this approach has limitations. Without an alternative for the increasing demand for 5G and other digital infrastructure and technologies, Southeast Asian countries will have little choice but to use Chinese providers. A more constructive approach would be for the U.S. and like-minded countries to incentivize competition in the Southeast Asian market. Although the U.S. is advanced in 5G baseband chips and other digital technologies, it lacks a domestic manufacturer that can rival the Chinese 5G equipment companies.However, the U.S. can partner with foreign firms to challenge China's dominance. South Korea would be an ideal partner for the U.S. in its efforts to check China's dominance in the digital transformation of Southeast Asia. South Korea and the U.S. have been trusted allies for seven decades. They have cooperated in various fields, including sensitive military/security matters. When it comes to 5G equipment, Samsung is well-positioned since its plants are located in South Korea and India. The other major non-Chinese 5G equipment manufacturers, Ericsson and Nokia, have significant manufacturing operations in China, which makes them vulnerable to Beijing's sanctions. Additionally, Samsung long ago won Pentagon clearance for government use of its devices equipped with its proprietary Knox security software, which is trusted by the U.S. military for safeguarding sensitive phone data.Moreover, Southeast Asian consumers generally have favorable views towards South Korean firms in the digital field. South Korea has not entered the Southeast Asian 5G market yet, but a survey report on the 2020 State of Southeast Asia suggests that Samsung was ranked the most preferable partner in building 5G infrastructure in the majority of the ten Southeast Asian countries. Finally, with the rising popularity of Korean pop culture and consumer products in Southeast Asia, South Korea is enjoying a spike in soft power, giving South Korean firms a competitive edge over China.From South Korea's perspective, cooperation with the U.S. in the Southeast Asian 5G market would further South Korea's New Southern Policy, which aims to deepen South Korea's partnerships with Southeast Asian and South Asian countries. The policy aims to diversify its diplomatic relations, which heretofore have been focused on just four major powers (the U.S., China, Japan and Russia), as well as to alleviate its own economic dependence on China. Entering the 5G equipment market in Southeast Asia would not only help South Korea enhance its presence in the region, but also diversify its economic interests away from China, leaving it less susceptible to Chinese sanctions.South Korea would benefit from U.S. companies' advanced digital technologies, including microchips, software and operating systems, self-driving vehicle technology, and satellite-based technologies. It would also benefit from Washington's existing partnerships with countries in Southeast Asia, which include decades of economic and military assistance. By combining forces, the U.S. and South Korea can jointly finance projects in Southeast Asia that match China's lavish financing. They have a better chance together to check China's growing digital influence that will eventually pressure Southeast Asian countries to downgrade their relations with the United States.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;['Lami Kim'];https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat-2021-05-21-2.jpg;False;;21.656292;8df556bf96df44be873abe5ff46c9c53;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

The 
China-Central Asia summit held in Xi'an
 last month marked the opening of the '
Year of Culture and Art of the Peoples of China and Central Asia
.' Besides an important occasion to take stock of 
infrastructure and business deals
 in the region, the Chinese government has once again focused on cultural exchange, in an effort to combat Sinophobia.
The Diplomat interviewed Giulia Sciorati, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Trento, where she researches China-Central Asia relations, to better understand the reach of China's cultural diplomacy in Central Asia.
What is the role of cultural diplomacy in China's overall foreign policy?
Sixteen years ago, we could have quickly answered this question by stressing the importance of culture China's vision of soft power. Nowadays, even the notion of soft power is contested. Experts disagree on whether it is still a relevant prism of analysis. The concept of 'narrative power' has gained an increasingly important status in international relations and the 'new' Chinese soft power falls precisely into this category. Xi Jinping's invitation to 'tell the China story well' (讲好中国故事
) has resonated widely and clearly. Cultural products make it easier to 'tell a good story,' especially in a visual world like ours. Cultural diplomacy remains therefore very relevant, at least to this particular strategy in Chinese foreign policy.

Has China's cultural diplomacy in Central Asia changed in recent years?

In Central Asia, China's cultural diplomacy has not particularly changed either region-wise or sector-wise. Indeed, travel restrictions imposed by the  pandemic have forced activities in this sector to move into the digital realm. We have seen that more attention has been paid to visuals such as videos, images, and photographs on traditional and social media. However, I would not say that this hints at a change in the whole cultural diplomacy infrastructure, because the core messaging has remained the same with topics such as the 'Silk Road' and 'Chinese traditional medicine' still under the spotlight. One important aspect to underline here is that these topics are not exclusive to Central Asia but are relatively common to how China uses culture worldwide.
What sort of tools does the Chinese government employ in its cultural diplomacy outreach in Central Asia?
The most important tool that China uses in Central Asia are scholarships for Central Asian students and scholars to travel to China and funds to set up Chinese studies programs around the region. In short, the education sector. This is important because it allows China to brand itself in a very specific way to Central Asian audiences (especially the younger generations). Another aspect that has proven particularly relevant in this domain is media cooperation, including media training for Central Asian journalists and media specialists in China. This is a way to promote the diffusion of a specific 'story' on China that would eventually not exclusively be told by Chinese media but also by other outlets in the region.

Is China's cultural diplomacy in Central Asia working? Is it taming the widespread Sinophobia that exists in the region?
The short answer is that it does not work as well as hoped. Several Chinese academic studies point to the shortcomings of China's public diplomacy in Central Asia. However, in my opinion, the identity value system created by China's discursive constructions of the history and culture shared with Central Asian countries (for instance, the 'Silk Road nations' identity) is too valuable to set aside. Even if it has limited pull with Central Asian audiences, it has proven to work well among political and diplomatic communities, at least as a broad frame to group several activities, agreements, and interactions.
How do you distinguish between museum cooperation and cultural diplomacy?
There is a lot of debate among specialists on this point, and there is no one-size-fits-all definition. My analysis shows that international cooperation in the heritage sector (including between museums) is generally aimed at marketizing national or transnational heritage as cultural products to engage foreign audiences. In simpler terms, consider traveling museum exhibitions through which heritage unique to a country or culture is displayed worldwide. Although this results from extensive museum cooperation and does not exclusively serve political aims, it still achieves cultural diplomacy goals.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2023-06-14-125922.jpg;False;;21.415417;81156539e8faef631a9fee2248ca5c26;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

This was their second meeting, the first having been held in New York in September 2019, and it built on the inaugural discussion but also took into consideration the COVID-19 pandemic and the intensifying U.S.–China rivalry.With the four countries growing increasingly wary of China's intentions, they have been touting the concept of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP), although their thinking here is hardly perfectly aligned. Nonetheless, these foreign ministers' meetings have allowed them to identify some common ground.The First Japan–Australia–India–U.S. Foreign Ministers' Meeting in 2019 sought to affirm a general framework. The ministers began by stressing 'their shared commitment to close cooperation on maritime security, quality infrastructure, and connectivity' based on 'preserving and promoting a rules-based order in the region.' Second, they identified and discussed 'cooperative initiatives including counter-terrorism, cyber security, and regional disaster response as significant areas for ongoing engagement.' Third, they affirmed 'their strong support for ASEAN centrality and the ASEAN-led regional architecture.'Subsequently, in November 2019, the Quad met in Bangkok. Counter-terrorism, cyber security, maritime security, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief were identified as specific areas of cooperation, and the four countries also welcomed the 'ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific,' which was adopted at the ASEAN Summit Meeting in June and can be seen as an ASEAN vision for the Indo-Pacific. Consultations were also held again – this time online – in September 2020. There, the four countries discussed pandemic cooperation, although the specific areas of cooperation were unchanged from earlier discussions. Yet the meeting's most notable feature was the solidifying of the 'Indo-Pacific' vision, and particularly the area of key agreement: 'a free, open, prosperous, rules-based and inclusive Indo-Pacific.'NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter The second foreign ministers' meeting held in Tokyo last month was more substantive, and as such the discussions appear to have entered a new phase.Enjoying this article?

The U.S. in particular is interested in rules for the digital economy, and issue that has risen in importance with the COVID-19 pandemic.Second, the meeting apparently 'exchanged views on regional affairs such as North Korea and East and South China Seas.' North Korea had been discussed at previous meetings too, but it is significant that the East and South China Seas were specifically incorporated. This suggests that concerns about China are growing. Third, although the ministers had previously welcomed involvement in the Indo-Pacific, in Tokyo they specifically 'welcomed proactive efforts by other countries including those in Europe toward a ‘Free and Open Indo-Pacific.'' In fact, France, the U.K., and others have also expressed an interest in the security of this space as they possess territories in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.Japanese Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide meanwhile took his first foreign trip in October 2020, visiting Vietnam and Indonesia. On this trip, too, FOIP was a key topic.AdvertisementAs all this goes on, China cannot be expected to remain silent. Indeed, on a visit to Southeast Asia around the same as Suga's trip, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi disparaged the FOIP as an Asian version of NATO. He did not mention Japan by name, only the U.S., but the criticism of Japan was implied. China is advocating a Digital Silk Road, so it is perhaps in the digital economy that we may first see friction between FOIP and China's Belt and Road Initiative.Shin Kawashima is a professor at the University of Tokyo.;thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;James;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat-2020-11-16.jpg;False;;21.352936;a3509d9a6ee4187f76ad9a8db3d459cb;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

The mega-project seeks to allocate $40 billion in infrastructure and resources for development in countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia by 2035.As described by the U.S. government, B3W is 'a values-driven, high-standard, and transparent infrastructure partnership' whose overall goal is to invest in infrastructure development in low- and middle-income countries, focusing on four main areas: climate, health and health security, digital technology, and gender equity and equality, with the aim of helping to reduce the infrastructure deficit in the developing world, further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.Chinese-led infrastructure projects have seen decades of expansion in many emerging markets. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the Asian giant has focused more on sustainable, digital and health-related aspects: the so-called Green, Digital, and Health Silk Roads.Thus, the B3W aims to support the development of global infrastructures, from Latin America and the Caribbean to Africa and the Indo-Pacific, taking advantage of this strategic window of opportunity to influence production chains and trade relations in areas where its presence is increasingly weak.NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
The White House's Vision for B3WEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.While there is little information on how the B3W will work in practice, a key aspect for the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of the initiative is, on the one hand, the mobilization of private capital through the expansion of existing development finance instruments, bilateral partnerships, multilateral banks, and other international financial institutions. The other area of emphasis is transparency in public financing.The B3W aims to meet the infrastructure needs in the recipient countries and communities by promoting quality standards in relation to environment and climate, anti-corruption, social inclusion and labor guarantees. Standards will follow, as a benchmark, the Blue Dot Network, an initiative launched by the United States, Australia, and Japan in 2019 to provide evaluation and certification criteria for infrastructure projects for development.The White House has stated that infrastructure under B3W will be developed in a transparent and sustainable manner – financially, environmentally, and socially – consulting with communities and assessing local needs as true partners, which will provide long-term benefits and generate greater development impact.AdvertisementThey also highlighted the commitment to the principles of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement and the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda, as well as promoting health security, digital technology, and gender equality, goals that coincide with other G-7 initiatives, ranging from global vaccine distribution to decarbonization and expanding girls' education rights.With the B3W in mind, a delegation led by Daleep Singh, deputy national security advisor for international economics in the Biden administration, undertook a working tour to Ghana and Senegal in West Africa, where they met with government officials, private sector representatives, as well as environmental, labor, and civil society leaders to jointly identify projects that address local infrastructure needs.Ten projects were discussed, including the creation of a vaccine manufacturing center in Senegal, the reduction of the digital divide, the strengthening of the supply of renewable energies, and the promotion of loans to women-owned businesses. The parties involved also accepted the transparency guarantees demanded by the U.S. regarding the commitment to make the agreements fully public.In October, another delegation visited Ecuador, Colombia, and Panama, and another is scheduled to visit Asia before the end of the year. The aim is to present the inaugural B3W projects during a G-7 meeting in December this year.B3W and BRI: Strategic Competition?Since China's President Xi Jinping announced the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013, G-7 countries have consistently expressed in different international and academic forums their concern about China's political, economic, technological and military influence in the West. Importantly, the G-7 fell into a pattern of highlighting the BRI's shortcomings without presenting a concrete alternative to it.Therefore, many analysts saw in the announcement of B3W the search for a new relationship between the West and developing nations, framed in a possible 'strategic competition' with BRI.Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.At least in principle, the plans differ markedly in scope and funding. The B3W in its initial objectives focuses on human (soft) infrastructure such as education, environment, healthcare, gender equality, and digital technology. By contrast, the BRI keeps the focus of its global development interests on traditional projects such as ports, roads, railroads, power plants, and telecommunications facilities (hard infrastructure), although recently, China has expressed its intentions to develop the Health, Green, and Digital Silk Roads.Another differentiating aspect is financing. The B3W aims to finance its infrastructure investments primarily from the Development Finance Corporation, USAID, EXIM, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, as well as other complementary agencies such as the Transaction Advisory Fund. The G-7 countries have also announced that they will mobilize a considerable amount of private capital.In contrast, the BRI has as the initiative's 'financial engine' the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) operating since 2016, the China Development Bank (created in 2014), the Silk Road Fund, Chinese banks, and other entities with substantial investments to back the project.AdvertisementThe truth is that both initiatives seem, at first glance, to be more complementary than competitive.How could the B3W impact Latin America?Latin America's Role in the United States' and China's strategiesChina has a robust presence in the region. A recent study prepared by Boston University and the think-tank Inter-American Dialogue concluded that China lent Latin America about $1.7 billion a year between 2005 and 2015, but has reduced that figure by half since 2016, dropping to $275 million in 2019. The report notes that the Asian giant did not make any loans to the region in 2020.However, Margaret Myers, head of the China and Latin America program at the Inter-American Dialogue and co-author of the study, does not consider that there is a real slowdown. Rather, she argues that Chinese investment is occurring through other channels. This represents a change in the strategy for the region, where direct state-to-state loans were reduced and the purchase of local companies, the territorial deployment of Chinese banks, and participation in public tenders increased.The Latin American region has an important relative weight thanks to its strategic resources, demography, North-South geography, and Atlantic-Pacific connection. As a result, soft power tools such as trade, diplomacy, financing or assistance are increasingly used by both the United States and China.In this framework, the escalation of the economic, technological and geopolitical war between the two powers may have an impact on markets, on the possibilities of debt financing, and on the pressure to maintain political and diplomatic alignment.Indeed, the region presents differentiated geo-economic spaces: North America, Central America and the Caribbean, and South America.North America, in its partnership through the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement effectively excludes closer trade ties with China. Article 32 of the treaty states that each member shall refrain from engaging in relations with non-market economiesCentral America and the Caribbean is a subregion critical to U.S. security. Here, the U.S. and China alike have been implementing soft power tools to secure diplomatic allies in the China-Taiwan dispute. The growing economic and diplomatic presence of the Asian giant is perceived as a threat by Washington.In South America, China has achieved significant geoeconomic penetration in a key subregion due to its energy and water resources and the importance of its trade routes.In this scenario, which oscillates between competition and contention from the great powers, the countries of the region should avoid a bipolar logic and instead build mechanisms for political and economic cooperation and integration under conditions that allow for greater benefits for their citizens.AdvertisementEnjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.The geopolitical reading indicates that the B3W initiative is intended to be the West's return to a more active presence on the global chessboard, modifying its critical stance toward the Chinese BRI and offering a real alternative with concrete options to developing countries.Boosting global multilateralism through economic recovery and global prosperity for low and middle income nations is a smart bet. The initial development of financially, environmentally, and socially sustainable soft infrastructures provides the basis for a strategic rearticulation between the West and developing nations, boosting global multilateralism.Regardless of their strategic intentions, the B3W and BRI initiatives are a major win for global welfare, and a two-way opportunity for Latin America.This piece was originally published in Spanish by ReporteAsia.";;2310;news;ID;en;[];https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2021-12-22-152509.jpg;False;;21.17526;17fb72cd6ae52f4df69cb5dca44a03a2;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}
83;In Serbia, China's Digital Silk Road Might Be in Trouble Very Soon;Shannon;2020-09-23 13:09:44;full;https://thediplomat.com/2020/09/in-serbia-chinas-digital-silk-road-might-be-in-trouble-very-soon;thediplomat.com;A breakthrough agreement signed between Serbia and Kosovo could spell the end of Huawei's thriving presence in Serbia.;"AdvertisementOn September 4, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and the prime minister of Kosovo, Avdullah Hoti, signed an economic normalization agreement in the presence of U.S. President Donald Trump. No one expected that China would be mentioned, let alone that it would be impacted by an agreement addressing the Balkan dispute.China was not mentioned in the deal by name, but it did not have to be. One of the provisions of the signed agreement states: 'Both parties will prohibit the use of 5G equipment supplied by untrusted vendors in their communications network. Where such an agreement is already present, both parties commit to removal and other mediation efforts in a timely fashion.' The 'untrusted vendors' were not identified. Still, there is no doubt that the phrase referred to the Chinese tech giant, Huawei, and that it targets Serbia, which has a partnership with Huawei. Consequently, the fate of China's digital juggernaut in Serbia is uncertain and dependent on U.S. policy toward Belgrade.In the past decade, the Chinese presence in the Balkans has gradually increased, and partnership with Serbia has been its cornerstone. This partnership has also involved the technological domain. Huawei established a strong presence in Serbia, giving Belgrade a special place on what is called 'the Digital Silk Road.' The foundation for this partnership was set in 2009 when Serbia and China signed an Agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation in the Field of Infrastructure.More recently, the Serbian Ministry of Interior selected Huawei as its partner for the 'Safe City' project, where 1,000 Huawei-made surveillance cameras equipped with advanced facial and license plate recognition software will be installed across Belgrade. The locations of most of these cameras are undisclosed. The Serbian Ministry of Interior provided to the public a list of some sites in Belgrade where surveillance cameras are placed, but Huawei is not mentioned. In implementing the Safe City project, the Ministry of Interior will also rely on eLTE, an advanced wireless broadband system supplied by Huawei.In 2018, the Serbian Ministry of Finance signed an agreement with the Chinese company on the provision of Huawei traffic surveillance systems, including for Chinese infrastructure projects. Huawei is also Serbia's partner on the 'the Smart City' project planned for the cities of Belgrade, Novi Sad, and the city selected for the pilot project, Niš. In March 2020 Huawei helped another Serbian city, Kragujevac, launch the City Data Center. There are also plans for Huawei to construct in Kragujevac a regional data center for South and Southeast Europe, making it a third regional data center for Huawei in Europe, after the ones in Netherlands and Germany.Enjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.The state-owned telecommunications operator, Telekom Srbija has a 150 million euro ($177 million) project with Huawei on the establishment of high-speed broadband internet, which might be a springboard for future 5G infrastructure in Serbia. Beyond the state-owned firm, a private telecom company, Telenor Serbia, formerly owned by Norwegians and now by a group from the Czech Republic, also has a partnership with Huawei.Based on the above, it's no surprise that Nenad Popovic, Serbia's minister for technological development, said in May 2020 that 'Huawei has arrived in Serbia to stay for a long time.'Now, this elaborate list of cooperation projects is in jeopardy as President Donald Trump and the United States have Huawei and China in their crosshairs again. In May 2019, Trump imposed sanctions against Huawei, banning U.S. companies from selling technology to the Chinese company and putting Huawei in the heart of what is usually referred to as a U.S.-China tech war. A reprieve was provided to some technology sales, but now Trump is escalating again. After the U.K., the United States' primary European ally, banned Huawei from its 5G network, Trump is pressuring other European allies to do the same. In August 2020, the Trump administration mandated that manufacturers globally cannot use U.S. technology and software for the production of Huawei semiconductors.AdvertisementAs Trump faces low re-election odds amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump sees punishing China for the outbreak as part of his electoral strategy, and Huawei is also on the hit list. But the strategy is not a hard sell politically. According to the Pew Research Center surveys, 73 percent of U.S. adults have an unfavorable view of China and countering China (and Huawei specifically) is one of the rare issues of bipartisan agreement between Republicans and the Democrats.Thus it was only a matter of time before Serbian ties with China would put Serbia on the United States' radar. Trump's reengagement with the Kosovo dispute was motivated by the desire to score a foreign policy win for his re-election campaign. However, resolving what is for most Americans an obscure Balkan dispute is not enough in the world of COVID-19. So Trump's mediation in the Kosovo dispute was directly linked with his China policy.Now, Belgrade is caught between Washington and Beijing. For Serbia and Vucic, Trump might be the best bet to get a less painful settlement to the Kosovo dispute. Indeed, after the White House meeting, Vucic told the Serbian public that Serbia had finally managed to open the door to the White House. However, it will not be easy or cheap for Serbia to give up on its partnership with Huawei. Indeed, a decision to remove Huawei from its telecommunications system will cost a much larger and wealthier U.K. 2 billion pounds. No similar calculations exist on how much it would cost Serbia to sever its extent cooperation with Huawei. Even without 5G stations, getting rid of Huawei's technology will doubtless be expensive.Serbia is uneasy about its options. One week after the White House meeting, Vucic had a meeting with Chinese Ambassador to Serbia Chen Bo, where the president explained that the agreement signed in Washington would not impact Serbia's partnership with China, including in telecommunications. Three days later Chen, alongside Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic, opened Huawei's Innovations and Development Center. On that occasion, Brnabic said: 'Serbia is not interested in unreliable technologies either; on the contrary, it is in the interest of the tender for the introduction of the 5G network to be open and transparent, while respecting international standards, which includes the agreement from Washington.'NGet first-read access to major articles yet to be released, as well as links to thought-provoking commentaries and in-depth articles from our Asia-Pacific correspondents.Subscribe Newsletter For the time being, Serbia will continue being evasive about Huawei as none of the current collaboration projects relates to the construction of 5G infrastructure. But this reprieve is only temporary. The public auction for the 5G spectrum in Serbia will be held during the first quarter of 2021. Moreover, while the formal date has not yet been set, Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to visit Serbia back in April.Meanwhile, the Serbian economy is expected to experience a sharp contraction as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Serbian Fiscal Council predicts a 6.5 percent drop in Serbia's GDP as well as job losses, and that same body believes that Serbia will have to ask for 6.5 billion euros in international loan. Serbia has already shown uneasiness with loans and aid from institutions like the European Union and International Monetary Fund because of their liquidity and transparency criteria. China, with its more secretive way of doing things, might be more appealing. However, what happens if the potential bailout loan from China gets negotiated during Xi's visit to Serbia and Beijing conditions the loan on the construction of the 5G network in Serbia by Huawei? Serbia and Vucic would truly be in a tough spot.The document signed in the White House is not legally binding. Still, Vucic knows the political and strategic weight of signing a document in the Oval Office next to the U.S. president. The United States will undoubtedly be in the mind of Vucic while he talks about 5G projects with Xi, regardless of whether Trump is still in the White House in 2021. The one thing that Belgrade cannot afford under any circumstances is the prospect of U.S. financial sanctions. This became obvious in December 2019 when Serbia stopped military purchases from Moscow to avoid U.S. sanctions. For now, Serbia is buying time, but if Washington decides to lash out against Huawei with economic sanctions, Belgrade's technological partnership with Huawei is dead, and so is the Balkan route of the Chinese 'Digital Silk Road.'Enjoying this article?

The then Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition government of Najib Abdul Razak signed a mega-infrastructure deal with China called the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL), which became the flagship BRI project in Malaysia.When a new coalition, Pakatan Harapan (PH), came into power after the 2018 elections, it raised a lot of questions about ECRL, questioning its financing, lop-sided deal, and even possible involvement in corruption. But the PH government never repudiated the whole concept of the BRI. It continued to see the BRI as providing good opportunities for countries like Malaysia to upgrade and improve their infrastructure. The adaptable BRI, which now expands to policy areas such as digital connectivity (Digital BRI), green development (Green BRI), and public health (Health Silk Road) provide various kinds of opportunities for Malaysia to improve in these different policy sectors.NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter The PH government also saw Chinese advances in future-oriented industries such as AI, robotics, e-commerce, and the Internet of Things as opportunities for Malaysia to tap into. The challenges lie in the implementation of the BRI vision, namely how the individual projects were negotiated and executed. Here, countries, including Malaysia, need to be well prepared in negotiating these projects so that the projects have a high chance to be a net positive for their economic development.Enjoying this article?

Diplomatically Malaysia understands China sees support for the BRI as an important indicator of how countries assess their relationship with China. Kuala Lumpur wants to preserve a stable and positive relationship with Beijing and is willing to give strong rhetorical support to the BRI. But beyond that, there is also a genuine belief among many politicians and policymakers in Malaysia, across the political divide, that Chinese investment into the infrastructure sector in Malaysia potentially could bridge the gap of regional economic balances in Malaysia. Moreover, Chinese capital, technology, and talent can be well harnessed to support Malaysia's next phase of economic development and upgrade its industrial chain to a more technologically advanced stage. From 1970s and 1990s, Malaysia relied a lot on Western and Japanese capital and technology during its early phase of industrialization. China is now a major economy (though not the only one), that is able to replicate that role for Malaysia's economic and technological development.How is Malaysia preserving its national interests amid U.S.-China rivalry in Southeast Asia?AdvertisementThe U.S.-China rivalry provides some immediate, short-term benefits in the sense that both major powers are offering benefits to Malaysia in a competitive context. But overall speaking, the deterioration of U.S.-China relations, and the destabilizing implications of such a rivalry in the region, is not something Malaysia welcomes. It prefers that the big powers settle and manage their differences. Malaysia continues to adhere to a non-aligned foreign policy. Its behavior is often described as 'hedging' rather than balancing or bandwagoning. Although Malaysia is a party to the South China Sea dispute and is wary about the increasing assertiveness of China, it does not want the dispute to affect its overall ties with China, nor does it want to be drawn into the U.S.-China rivalry because of the dispute.Analyze domestic factors in Kuala Lumpur's decision-making to advance Malaysia's foreign policy priorities.Malaysia's foreign policy is less determined by public opinion. Traditionally foreign policy has been very much an elite-driven process, with the prime minister as the center. Given the political distractions in the country right now, there is even less attention being given to foreign policy. By and large the country's foreign policy has to serve, or at least not contradict significantly, the need for national economic development, which is crucial for ensuring political support for the government of the day.Assess Malaysia's expectations for U.S. leadership in Southeast Asia.Malaysia definitely continues to welcome the U.S. to be a constructive actor in the region, to support ASEAN, and to be a reliable partner in improving the region's economic development, public health, education, and so forth. It will also welcome the U.S. to provide a stabilizing balance in the context of the rising influence of China. But the U.S. should not cast its relationship with Beijing in overly ideological and confrontational terms and expect countries in the region to choose sides. Instead, Malaysia expects and wishes that for the U.S. to show leadership, it should contribute to public goods, pursue multilateral engagement, be less ideological and more pragmatic, and respect how the countries in the region pursue their own national interests.;thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;Shannon;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat-2020-11-23-12.jpg;False;;19.973793;c114ad359bc38360ae1c1aab794cadd8;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

The 'soft' components are a different story.;"Advertisement

When the United States and its allies began evacuating from Kabul on August 15, as the Taliban entered the Afghan capital, China decided to keep its embassy open and claimed it was ready for friendly relations with the Taliban. State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had already met with Taliban representatives in late July in Tianjin to discuss the reconciliation and reconstruction process in Afghanistan. During that meeting, the Taliban also agreed not to support Uyghur separatists who might threaten stability in Xinjiang. China has a principle of not intervening in internal affairs abroad and expects other parties to have the same policy. On this basis, China and the Taliban's Afghanistan may develop new ties.

China's policy toward the Taliban is sometimes misunderstood in Western countries, but it reflects China's Realpolitik and ambitions for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Central Asia and South Asia. The new relations between Beijing and Kabul may accelerate the development of China's flagship connectivity program in the region with the construction of new infrastructure facilities, but without deep evolutions, the Taliban regime may not be able to implement the 'soft' BRI, which involves programs ranging from education to health. However, the huge opportunities offered by China's BRI may soften the Taliban's fundamentalism.

The Taliban and the 'Hard' BRI

The first Memorandum of Understanding on the BRI between Afghanistan and China was signed in 2016, and then several initiatives were agreed between the two countries. However, because of terrorism, few projects were actually conducted within the framework of the BRI. In addition, Afghanistan's climatic and geographic conditions also make the construction of routes difficult.

Due to the lack of proper networks and pervasive insecurity, untapped Afghan mineral resources have hardly been exploited. If the Taliban succeed in bringing stability back to Afghanistan, China may invest in several sectors, including mining.

But for China, stability in Afghanistan is also a prerequisite for the development and success of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a major segment of the BRI. In Pakistan, China has been investing billions of U.S. dollars in the construction of roads, special economic zones, and ports. But due to geographic conditions and tensions with India in Kashmir, the Chinese city of Kashgar is still hardly connected with the corridor, and projects face delays.

In southern Pakistan, China is developing the port of Gwadar, which is to become a major hub for energy. However, to be profitable, the new port needs to serve as a terminal for natural gas from Central Asia, through Afghanistan. But transportation by routes or pipelines could not be planned in this war-torn country. With a 'Pax Talibana' in Afghanistan, both China and Pakistan can envisage new infrastructure facilities that may connect Gwadar to Central Asia. Once those networks are built, Gwadar will also become much more attractive to foreign investors, especially from the Gulf region, as they have, until now, shown some reluctance to invest in Gwadar because of a lack of prospects.

The new regime in Kabul may also prevent the development of troubles in Pakistan where Chinese-constructed projects have been targeted. Pakistan claims that Indian and Afghan intelligence agencies were involved in the Dasu terror attack on July 14, where several Chinese citizens were killed by the Pakistani Taliban. Good relations between Pakistan and the Taliban may improve the security environment for Chinese construction projects in the CPEC.

The Challenging 'Soft' BRI



These 'hard' BRI projects may successfully be implemented under the Taliban. However, the BRI is much more than just a few railroads or ports; it is about facilitating trade and exchanges between China and the world. The Belt and Road Initiative includes many 'soft' components from the Health Silk Road to the Digital Silk Road, and these initiatives rely on innovation. Participation in the BRI demands that the Taliban be more open to changes and conduct reforms that are in line with China's interests.

Countries that are active in the BRI tend to replicate, with more or less success, a Chinese model based on special incentives offered to companies as well as specific reforms where the priority is given to education. One of the most important achievements made by China over the last 30 years is in regard to education. In 1990, the gross school enrollment rate in tertiary education was only 3 percent, but it rose to more than 53 percent in 2019, and China now tops the PISA ranking. China has also become a top destination for foreign students from developing countries, especially from Africa. To gain long-term benefits from the BRI, the Taliban will need to change their views on education and adopt a Chinese model where science is a priority.

China will also want to see the Taliban change their stance on women. China's unprecedented growth since 1978 is partly due to the participation of women, who are said to 'hold up half the sky.' Some of China's most successful companies have been led by businesswomen, like Sun Yang, who served as chairwomen of Huawei from 1999 to 2018, or Jane Jie Sun, CEO of Trip.com since 2016. This is due again to education: In 2009, for the first time, female students outnumbered male students in Chinese colleges.

China also expects the Taliban to soften their tone toward ethnic and religious minorities in Afghanistan if they want to join the BRI. In the past, the Taliban were accused of ethnic cleansing against minorities such as Hazaras. But the continuation of this abuse will elevate the risk of terror attacks against the infrastructure facilities that are to be constructed by Chinese companies in Afghanistan. Segregation and harassment against Shias or Uzbeks would also threaten relations with neighboring countries like Iran or Uzbekistan and challenge the roll-out of regional multilateral projects financed and constructed by China. Similarly, the Taliban should not transform Afghanistan into a destination for terrorists who would plan attacks in Xinjiang or other countries in Central Asia that support the BRI, as China would never tolerate this.

The rule of law and the fight against corruption are other targets that the Taliban will need to address. Although large-scale investment projects will be agreed between governments and will involve Chinese state-owned companies, for Afghanistan to attract investment from smaller private Chinese companies, some consistent legal reforms will be required in accordance with Islamic law, but also, more importantly, with Chinese laws. Without the insurance that the Taliban will secure Chinese investment in Afghanistan, Beijing will be quite cautious about developing major projects in this country.

If China does not intervene directly in Afghan internal affairs to implement these changes, it is very likely that other countries that enjoy close relations with the Taliban, such as Pakistan or some Gulf states, which are all very supportive of the BRI, will pressure new authorities in Kabul to follow more pro-China policies. Continuing chaos in Afghanistan would jeopardize CPEC projects in Pakistan, something that Islamabad cannot afford.

The soft and hard elements of the BRI are two sides of the same coin. Whereas the Taliban's regime can ease the construction of infrastructure by China in Afghanistan, it is still doubtful that the Taliban would manage to develop the 'soft BRI' as it requires the transformation of the Taliban regime. However, in the end, if the BRI is properly implemented, China may succeed in normalizing Afghanistan where years of wars, occupation, and foreign intervention have failed.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;[];https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2021-08-05-8.jpg;False;;19.425297;7b855f6be9635a132fbaa2da77e2e61a;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

The leaders of the G-7 nations and the European Union gather in Hiroshima, Japan, starting on May 19. But their summit is being preceded by a series of ministerial meetings in various picturesque cities in Japan to lay the groundwork on a number of important topical issues. As the current cold war atmosphere between the U.S.-led Western allies and China centers around technology competition, the 
G-7 digital and tech ministers' gathering
 in Takasaki, Gunma Prefecture, in late April took on special importance.
With relatively little fanfare, a 
Ministerial Declaration
 was issued with six sections, identifying the areas where these leading Western democratic nations are focusing their efforts as they try to sustain technological leadership. That leadership is widely considered to be under threat from global geopolitical tensions and in particular, competition from China.
The first of these six points, 'facilitation of cross-border data flows and data free flow with trust,' reaffirms the importance of building and realizing trust 'through various legal and voluntary frameworks, guidelines, standards, technologies and other means that are transparent and protect data.' The ministers recognized the need to accelerate progress in this regard by establishing and launching the Institutional Arrangement for Partnership (IAP), 'to bring governments and stakeholders together to operationalize ‘data free flow with trust' (DFFT) through principles-based, solutions-oriented, evidence-based, multistakeholder and cross-sectoral cooperation.' The declaration set a goal of launching the IAP 'in the coming months.'
The second point, 'secure and resilient digital infrastructure,' is also clearly an area that has been drawing heightened concern recently, with growing geopolitical concerns over redundancy in face of potential disruptions. The digital ministers affirmed the important need to 'develop, deploy and maintain various multi-layered networks consisting of terrestrial networks, submarine cable networks, and non-terrestrial networks.' The declaration calls for extending 'secure and resilient digital infrastructure to like-minded partners, including developing and emerging economies.'

The ministers paid particular attention to the need to extend secure routes of submarine cables. In particular, the G-7 governments will 
work with
 the World Bank and the private sector telecom operators to undertake submarine cable projects with subsidies from G-7 nations and other international institutions. The goal is to support the critical infrastructure development of underserved regions in the world that have not received sufficient private investment. Specifically, Japan has committed to host 'an event and identify concrete areas of cooperation with the World Bank in 2023 to accelerate the strengthening of synergies between the G-7 and the Bank.'`

Recent media investigative reports have pointed out that China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has been pivoting from large-scale infrastructure projects to less capital-intensive areas], particularly in the field of digital infrastructure. Examples includes constructing a new government data center for Senegal, supported by Huawei, which also 
spearheaded another undersea cable project for Senegal
 with the island nation of Cape Verde, making Senegal an African regional cable hub. Previously commonly labeled as the 'Digital Silk Road' strategy, such investments in information and communications technology (ICT) and electronic components reached $17.6 billion in 2022, six times the amount in 2013, when the BRI was launched, according to reports from 
Nikkei Asia and the Financial Times's fDi Markets foreign direct investment monitor
. The United States and its partners will have a lot of catching up to do.
The third point in the G-7 declaration, 'i
nternet governance,
' echoes the expressed endorsement in the U.S.-led 
Declaration for the Future of the Internet
 for the multistakeholder model, which is seen as being challenged by China, Russia and other autocratic nations that hope to steerinternet governance toward a government-driven, top-down model. The forth point, 'emerging and disruptive technologies in innovating society and economy,' is, however, just a pledge of support for cooperation in policy setting for a mixed bag of different technologies, from Internet of Things to digital identity, and from semiconductor supply chain to the metaverse.
The fifth point specifically focused on 'responsible AI and global AI governance,' reaffirming that AI policies and regulations should be 'human centric and based on democratic values, including protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and the protection of privacy and personal data.' However, the meeting only concluded with an 
'action plan for promoting global interoperability between tools for trustworthy AI,'
 with little concrete agreement on how to deal with the growing concerns over the untamed development and proliferation of generative AI.

Interestingly, the final point, 'digital competition,' is an acknowledgement of the tensions between G-7 nations, particularly across the Atlantic, between the United States and Europe, over the wide gap in regulatory principles and laws overseeing the competition in digital markets. The meeting agreed to convene a summit on digital competition for regulators and policymakers in the fall of 2023 to facilitate promotion of competition and enforcement.
Further to these discussions, on May 12-14, 
the G-7 science ministers
 will gather in Sendai, Japan, to discuss cooperation on scientific research, funding transparency, research data sharing on sensitive technologies, etc.
All in all, as the United States has unveiled 
international economic policy
, through cooperation with its partners, with its centerpiece focusing on technological competition with China, it can be expected that the G-7 will play a crucial role in establishing and pursuing a more coherent strategy on multiple fronts. The G-7 digital and tech ministers' declaration offers hints to the priorities and approaches of the allies, as well as how it may engage the other advanced as well as emerging economies, such as those outside of the G-7 that are 
strategically invited
 to the upcoming summit like Australia, Brazil, India, South Korea, and Vietnam.

How are they different?;"Advertisement

Even as China's Belt and Road Initiative gears up to celebrate its 10th anniversary, it is fading from prominence. In its place is the new Global Development Initiative (GDI).

Chinese leader Xi Jinping announced the concept at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2021. By September 2022, over 60 nations had joined the Group of Friends of the GDI. The World Economic Forum hailed China's GDI as a 'timely call-for-action to address the immediate challenges that threaten our collective ability to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals.'

Meanwhile, the waning BRI is being eclipsed, if not replaced, by the GDI. What are the differences between the two, and why has China decided to push forward this new development initiative?

Distinct Contexts

Diplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter

Contextualizing and comparing the separate launches of the BRI and GDI can shed important light on the differing scopes and objectives of these two initiatives.



First, the international economic backgrounds at the time when these two initiatives were launched were quite different. The BRI arose at the end of the commodity boom, where trade with developing countries reached its peak whilst the rest of the world was struggling to recover from the Global Financial Crisis. The subsequent decline of commodity prices weakened the economic leverage China had been using to gain access to raw materials and to develop markets for its manufactured products. Therefore, the BRI was a vehicle for Beijing to cultivate linkages with the Global South beyond trade.

By contrast, the GDI was launched at the apex of the  pandemic, which not only disrupted global supply chains but also put many BRI-related infrastructure projects on hold. According to a survey in mid-2020, 20 percent of BRI projects were reported to be 'seriously affected' by the pandemic. In 2021, BRI-related investments fell to $56.5 billion from $60.5 billion in 2020. With the BRI losing momentum, it's no coincidence that China decided to launch a new development initiative taking a different approach – one less reliant on heavy infrastructure construction.

The geopolitical context also changed markedly between the BRI's launch and the GDI's. The BRI was launched amidst the United States' 'pivot to Asia' strategy, whereby Washington had just started to shift attention from the Middle East to the Asia-Pacific. The GDI was inaugurated against the backdrop of heightened great power competition and after the launch of a dedicated Indo-Pacific Strategy by the United States. Moreover, the United States and its allies began responding to the BRI with their own development arrangements – namely the B3W Initiative and the Global Gateway. Many regard them as rivals of the BRI, with the aim of asserting U.S. and European power in the realm of global infrastructure development.

The BRI and GDI also emerged from different domestic considerations within China itself. The GDI emerged at a time when China's government budget deficit problem has deteriorated, with debt levels rising from 2,1 percent of GDP in 2013 to 8.6 percent in 2020 before declining slightly to 6.1 percent in 2021. Consequently, the widened fiscal deficit has come to hinder China's capability of financing large-scale infrastructure projects under the BRI.

More broadly, the GDI followed the issuance of the 14th Five-Year Plan, which calls for a shift away from fixed-asset investment in speculative and unsustainable projects to more sustainable and financially profitable ones, including innovative, information, and integrated infrastructure projects. Hence, China's shift toward emphasizing sustainable economic growth at home, and the pursuit of higher domestic consumption, coupled with its exacerbating fiscal problems, created different incentives for China's development initiatives than the conditions seen in 2013, when China was leading the global recovery from the Global Financial Crisis.

Lastly, the venues for launching the two initiatives are symbolically different. The Silk Road Economic Belt was proposed in Kazakhstan, and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road was raised for the first time in Indonesia, both of which are large developing countries. The GDI, by contrast, was launched during the United Nations General Assembly. Having the U.N. as the inaugural setting for the GDI conveys Beijing's appetite – at least at its face value– to make this a multilateral arrangement. This is especially notable as the original BRI has been criticized for being a Sino-centric deal that prioritizes opaque bilateralism over inclusive multilateralism.

Different Operationalization

The GDI differs from the BRI not only in terms of background but also regarding its operationalization. To begin with, the main authorship of the policy documents explaining the two initiatives differs. While the National Development and Reform Commission is involved in most BRI-related policies, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is taking the lead in formulating GDI-related documents. In the case of the BRI, although the secretariat for the BRI coordination is within the National Development and Reform Commission, the plethora of participating institutions and the failure of different Chinese state actors – i.e. party leadership, functional bureaucracies, and economic arms – to coordinate a unified strategy for the BRI led to fragmented motives and policies.

According to the List of First-batch Projects of GDI Project Pool, the China International Development Cooperation Agency will play an important role in implementing GDI-related projects on poverty reduction, pandemic response, food security, climate actions, and digital economy. Although this development agency was instituted in 2018 to help promote the BRI, its output has been meager, largely because it remains a coordinating body of China's foreign aid policy. Now, its salience in implementing GDI projects would be a key factor to watch. Will the CIDCA play a more prominent role in China's foreign aid policy and can it overcome a much criticized project management style?

Moreover, multilateralism and engagement with civil society feature higher in the GDI-related projects. This can be reflected in either extensive cooperation with international organizations (e.g. the U.N. Development Program) in implementing the projects or the establishment of multilateral platforms for development (e.g. the International NGOs Network for Poverty Reduction Cooperation).



Further, the GDI and the BRI focus on distinct issue areas. Beijing has become more prudent about infrastructure financing 'due to its own economic woes, repayment problems and the low economic returns on its foreign loans, and accumulative complaints about the BRI adding to socio-environmental risks, unsustainable debts and governance and corruption issues in partner countries.' In contrast to the BRI, the GDI lays more emphasis on promoting software for development, i.e. poverty reduction, food security, pandemic responses, financing for development, climate change and green development, industrialization, digital economy, and connectivity.

Finally, the financing scheme for both initiatives varies. While the BRI is financed by a range of actors consisting of China policy banks, commercial banks, multinational development banks, and sovereign wealth funds, the GDI seems to rely primarily on the Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund (GDSSCF), which is an upgraded version of the erstwhile SSC Assistance Fund in partnership with the UNDP. According to the 2023 Progress Report on GDI, the GDSSCF amounts to $4 billion. Also, financing for the BRI involved a mix of grants, interest-free and/or concessional loans, whereas the fundings from GDSSCF takes the form of grants. Given that Beijing is increasingly cautious about its overseas foreign direct investment and funding large-size projects, the GDSSCF may address the criticisms concerning China's traditional foreign aid to developing countries, that is, corruption and the lack of transparency and accountability.

While no formal security concepts accompanied the BRI, the GDI is backed up by two other parallel initiatives, namely the Global  Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative. The GSI Concept Paper makes reference to 'development' 17 times, and suggests that a range of current world conflicts can be attributed to underdevelopment and, therefore, can be solved by development. Altogether, this collection of Chinese initiatives in the realm of development, security, and culture will have normative implication vis-à-vis the purported universalism of Western liberal understanding of concepts like human rights and development.

Admittedly, the BRI will not fade away for the short term; after all, it is enshrined in the CCP Charter. The concrete development of the GDI remains to be seen, but there are initial signs showing that the GDI is incrementally gaining momentum in a context far different from the one that conditioned the launch of the BRI one decade ago.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat-2020-09-22-11.jpg;False;;18.775322;685d72f794edc47ecf21e05486281354;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

Credit: U.S. NavyAdvertisementCapability and intent are the two fundamental lenses that can best predict risk and conflict. While there is ample space for misjudgment on the part of two adversaries, capability is much easier to evaluate than intent. In foreign policy, China's rise has gone through a number of iterations, each marked by a rhetoric of intent and suggestions about its capability.The 12-character Chinese aphorism quoted by Deng Xiaoping – 'Hide your brightness, bide your time' – is long dead. The late Chinese leader was fond of quoting the famous military strategist Sun Tzu, who advocated keeping one's strengths and capabilities a secret until the appropriate moment. Deng prioritized boosting national incomes and progressing Chinese economic policy first. In 2003, Zheng Bijian, a senior Chinese official, introduced a new concept in Beijing's foreign policy: the 'peaceful rise' (later modified to 'peaceful development.') Finally, Xi Jinping in 2013 expressed the intent for China to become a great power, in part by establishing its maritime dominance in the East and South China Seas. This has already had profound strategic ramifications and put China on a collision course with other regional powers.The big question is whether China truly intends to realize these ambitions, and whether it has the capability to do so. In this regard, an examination of these two issues in the context of merchant shipping, ports, and seabed cable communications is particularly instructive.First, China now controls a merchant fleet of more than 5,600 vessels with a capacity of 270 million dead-weight tonnage (dwt), making it the second-largest ship-owning country in the world. According to the Institute of  Shipping Economics and Logistics, China COSCO Shipping is the largest shipping company in the world, and controls over 800 merchant vessels with a combined 74.5 million dwt. By comparison, the numbers for the United States are weak when factoring the restrictions imposed by the Jones Act, a protectionist law passed in 1920, which requires that all goods that are transported by water between U.S. ports be carried by vessels constructed in the United States, flying the U.S. flag, and that are owned and crewed by U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Consequently, this lessens the number of ships available for the U.S. to use in international commerce.NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
China on the other hand, has undertaken a large merchant shipbuilding program through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Chinese shipbuilding companies are the largest in the world, which include the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Group, a subsidiary of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC), a state owned company with $120 billion in assets.Enjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.Second, and more worrisome, is that China has constructed, maintains, and operates dozens of ports globally, which give it a dominating advantage. In South Asia, for example, the strategic deep-water port at Hambantota in Sri Lanka was leased to Beijing for 99 years in return for $1.1 billion, to help the Sri Lankan government meet rising foreign debt repayments. Critical ports are a part of China's 'string of pearls' strategy that seeks to create a maritime link between eastern China and the African continent. Worse, Lonnie Henley of the China Maritime Studies Institute argued in May that merchant ships can be weaponized, giving China a logistical advantage in any attempt to invade Taiwan.Third, a 2021 report by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies warns that the U.S. position as the world's leading hub in subsea networks can no longer be taken for granted. Subsea networks are vital as they carry nearly all voice and internet traffic between continents, and while more of the world is becoming digitally connected, China has emerged a leading subsea cable provider. For example, between 2004 and 2019, the U.S. went from handling half of all internet traffic to less than 25 percent, while Xi Jinping has laid plans for a 'Digital Silk Road' to place China at the very center of global digital networks.A newly released report from the French Institute for International Studies on the geopolitics of submarine cables in Oceania, mainly the Pacific Islands nations, noted the growing politicization of the technology internationally. The author, Camille Morel, an associate researcher at the Institute for Strategy and Defense Studies at the University of Lyon, noted that by 2022, the 450 fiber-optic cables that stretch across the world carry as much as 98 percent of international data and are critical to digitally-connected societies. The report highlights China's use of seabed cables as an instrument of policy and to assert its sovereignty at sea. It uses seabed surveys to identify the best possible route for a cable, allowing China to occupy the space. In June, China reportedly carried out seabed surveys in Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone, close to the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, without Tokyo's permission.AdvertisementTo counter China's dominance in the digital sphere, Pacific and international powers need to invest heavily in digital infrastructure. Early efforts include the Trilateral Partnership for Infrastructure Investment in the Indo-Pacific, which was launched in 2018, which called for a fund to counter China's Chinese East Micronesia Cable project.Investment came to life in an MoU between Pacific Island states, Japan, the United States, and Australia. The U.S. warned that major telecom providers have been labeled a national security risk, as Article 7 of China's 2017 National Intelligence Law of the People's Republic of China states: 'All organizations and citizens shall support, assist, and cooperate with national intelligence efforts in accordance with law, and shall protect national intelligence work secrets they are aware of.'This erases the line between public and private sectors and places controls on tech companies to report material to Chinese security agencies. The threat posed by any tampering with undersea cables is serious, and China's commitment to expanding its submarine cable network leaves the issue of its intent in a troubling gray area.The legacy of Deng Xiaoping is certainly mixed. While many would suggest that Mao unified the country (minus Taiwan), Deng made it rich. However, the most problematic and challenging aspect is that meaningful political reform within the CCP was always severely limited. This total failure to undertake a long called-for Fifth Modernization of the country's politics opened the space for increased authoritarianism and the rise of hegemonic power projection.China has demonstrated tremendous capability in building economic and military power. There is no dispute that it has risen. But China's foreign policy assertiveness and the posturing of 'wolf warrior diplomacy' have generated serious concerns about China's intentions – especially at sea. The current international system, constructed by the dominant Western powers, has never allowed a rising power to overtly challenge the rules-based international order. These powers therefore have no choice but to either contain or confront China's extension of power at sea – whatever its ultimate intentions.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2022-09-28-071258.jpg;False;;18.476143;dd07146b5b72127500d31d9d90d1b8b0;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}
89;What AUKUS and Afghanistan Tell Us About the US Asia Strategy;;2021-09-21 14:30:00;timezone unknown;https://thediplomat.com/2021/09/what-aukus-and-afghanistan-tell-us-about-the-us-asia-strategy/;thediplomat.com;Put together, these two seemingly unrelated developments signal a new U.S. strategy in the competition with China.;"AdvertisementThe Taliban's rapid takeover of Afghanistan made headlines around the world. Few could have predicted that the predominantly Pashtun, Islamic fundamentalist group would resuscitate their power in summer 2021, after waging a 20-year insurgency against the U.S.-backed government in Kabul.In the aftermath of the U.S.-led invasion of 2001, the Taliban began challenging NATO and taking back vast territories in the southwest of Afghanistan after heavy regrouping in Pakistan. The signing of a withdrawal agreement with the U.S. in Doha emboldened the Taliban to press their advantage and end the 20-year-old war. Backed by the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), the Taliban notched swift successes as the U.S. withdrew its remaining troops from Afghanistan. By August 2021, the Taliban had conquered all of Afghanistan's major cities and ultimately Kabul. By September, they controlled the entire country after taking the mountainous Panjshir Valley, where the National Resistance Front, led by Ahmad Masoud, had vowed to continue fighting the Taliban.Less than a month later after the fall of Kabul, U.S. President Joe Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison launched a trilateral security partnership, called AUKUS, to counter China. The AUKUS pact will enable Australia to deploy nuclear-powered submarines, which are supposed to be built in Adelaide, making Canberra the seventh country in the world to have submarines propelled by nuclear reactors. The core goal of this trilateral pact is to contain the threat emanating from China's increased leverage in the Indo-Pacific and its worldwide ambitions. Not surprisingly, the formation of AUKUS spilled over into intensified Indo-Pacific tensions, especially over Taiwan, the South China Sea, and the East Indian Ocean.At the first glance, it seems that the developments in Afghanistan and Australia are unrelated events. One centered in the Hindukush Mountains; the other echoed 9,500 kilometers away, in the middle of the Indo-Pacific waters. Nevertheless, within a broader context, these two events are interconnected at the heart of the China-U.S. competition, forming the bookends of a new strategy I dub 'leave the Belt, press the Road.' By this, I mean that the U.S. will increasingly target China's Maritime Silk Road, while largely abandoning the land-based Silk Road Economic Belt. Succinctly put, the major front of the Sino-American infrastructure war is the Indo-Pacific rim, while the heart of Eurasia will be left to the destabilizing forces of the region.The establishment of AUKUS reaffirms the fact that the cornerstone of Washington's China containment strategy is pitched in the Indo-Pacific zone. Therefore, U.S. attention to the geographical locations at the heart of Eurasia will be degraded – but this is part of the plan. The U.S. lack of will or capability to keep up its presence in Eurasia may intentionally disrupt the stability of the Belt by generating a threatening power vacuum. The U.S. swift withdrawal from Afghanistan and the following empowerment of Taliban have the potential to destabilize Chinese land-based projects in Central Asia, Pakistan, and even Xinjiang. Although the chaotic drawdown of the war in Afghanistan has taken a toll on Biden's standing back home, the geopolitical vacuum in Afghanistan following the U.S. withdrawal could be utilized to counterbalance Moscow, Beijing, and even Tehran, who will now have to contend with the empowerment of Islamic extremists in Central and West Asia.Enjoying this article?

After almost a ten-year hiatus, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, also known as the Quad, was formally resumed in August 2017 to contain Beijing's maritime power projection in the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean. Initially founded in 2007, the Quad consists of Australia, India, Japan, and the U.S., heralding the possible formation of an Asian NATO to counter the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). There were even rumblings about a 'Quad Plus' when South Korea, New Zealand, and Vietnam joined the meetings in March 2020. The Malabar exercises hosted annually by India are a major manifestation of its military component.In a 2021 joint statement on 'The Spirit of the Quad,' the leaders of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States highlighted 'a shared vision for a Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP),' and a 'rules-based maritime order in the East and South China Seas' to counter China's maritime threat. This progress was concomitant with the EU's increasingly strategic attention toward the Indo-Pacific zone as France, Germany, and the U.K. accelerated their cooperation with the Quad Plus dialogue. Within this context, the AUKUS pact would supplement the Quad in counterbalancing China's increasing influence in the Indo-Pacific.NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
Although AUKUS and the Quad both show muscle and military technology firepower, they lack a foundational proportionality. The Belt and Road Initiative is Beijing's major geoeconomic strategy for challenging the U.S. hegemony around the globe, while the Quad and AUKUS are geostrategic and military tools in countering China in the Indo-Pacific zone. Phrased differently, there is a strategic gap between the threatening force and the deterring counterforce. It was this proportionality gap that pushed the Biden administration to launch a specific geoeconomic counterforce against the Belt and Road: Build Back Better World, or B3W, announced in June at the G-7 summit in Cornwall, U.K.AdvertisementLed by the U.S., B3W aims at countering Chinese global leverage through massive investment in the infrastructural development of the developing countries by 2035. The plan is supposed to provide around $40 trillion, mainly from the private sector, to low- and middle- income countries, from Latin America and the Caribbean to Africa and Asia. Guided by the standards and principles of the Blue Dot Network (BDN), the B3W projects vow to focus on several domains, particularly climate, health and health security, digital technology, and gender equity and equality. The global scope of the B3W would equip its G-7 partners with different geographic orientations to target specific low- and middle-income countries across the world. While the U.S. focuses on the Indo-Pacific, Japan and the EU will concentrate on Southeast Asia and the Balkans, respectively, all with the aim of countering Chinese global influence.The upcoming competition between B3W, now backed by the Quad and AUKUS, and the Chinese BRI is a prelude to the China-U.S. infrastructure war. The B3W is not just a U.S. financial response to China's economic ambitions; rather it is a strategic effort to transform the rising geopolitical arrangement of Greater Eurasia and its coastal waters by establishing a new model of development. In other words, the United States is unleashing a geoeconomic counterforce against China's BRI to achieve its grand geopolitical goals by mobilizing its private companies and those of its allies in massive infrastructure investment to control the BRI corridors. The new infrastructure war will determine the trajectory and path of the geopolitical battle between China and the U.S. for world domination in the 21st century.On the other side of the global power equation, China has successfully controlled Central Asian markets while pursuing its 'positive balance' doctrine among all parties in West Asia, wherein expanding cooperation with Beijing may be the only point all the regional powers can agree on. China's dramatic economic growth and internal stability have enticed non-democratic political systems in the region. Beijing has established close economic relations with the Persian Gulf sheikhdoms, Israel, Iran, and Turkey at the same time. However, Beijing's successful policy in cementing its connection with West Asia through Central Asia may be disrupted by threats emanating from Afghanistan. The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan will destabilize the land-based Belt while heavy pressure by the Quad and now AUKUS will counter the maritime Road.The world is on the verge of China-U.S. international competition. Regional developments, like AUKUS, and domestic transformations, like the Taliban takeover of Kabul, will both be crucial elements in the grand chessboard between the U.S. and China. Now that the dust has settled in Kabul, one could see how the Taliban's rising power is concomitant with the trilateral AUKUS pact. Both are milestones for a new phase in the Sino-American competition: leave the Belt, press the Road.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;[];https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2021-09-21-8.jpg;False;;18.345634;a90b3c407154f8992f8bed2b97b31e3f;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}
90;What Happened To China's BRI Projects in Malaysia?;;2021-10-05 12:30:00;timezone unknown;https://thediplomat.com/2021/10/what-happened-to-chinas-bri-projects-in-malaysia/;thediplomat.com;Of the slew of BRI megaproject deals signed over the first five years of the initiative, most have either been canceled or come to a standstill.;"AdvertisementIt has been nearly a decade since China's first Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) project gained a foothold in Malaysia, and despite the slew of megaproject deals signed in the initial five years, many have either come to a standstill or were cancelled.Among the few BRI projects left standing is the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL), which Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob, the country's third premier since Najib Razak was voted out of office in May 2018, vowed to resume and complete under the 12th Malaysia Plan.The 50 billion Malaysian ringgit ($11.9 billion) rail project linking the east and west coast of the Malaysian peninsula was subjected to multiple renegotiations and realignments following its suspension in 2018 by then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.The ECRL was one of many BRI projects put on ice amid allegations that Najib's administration intentionally agreed to lopsided deals with China at inflated prices to bail out debt-laden state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). Both China and Najib have denied the bailout claim.The suspicions, however, were later confirmed after Mahathir's Pakatan Harapan government gained access to classified documents, known as the 'red files,' which indicated that a number of China's BRI projects, such as the ECRL and two pipeline projects, contained dubious terms.Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.Mahathir made it clear that the ECRL was inflated by up to 30 billion ringgit to pay down 1MDB's debts, and that only 15 percent of the project's construction had been completed while 20 billion ringgit or 33 percent of the railway link's initial 60 billion ringgit price tag had been paid.It was the same with the multi-product petroleum and gas pipeline project in Sabah where only an average of 13 percent of the pipelines' construction had been completed even though 8.3 billion ringgit or 88 percent of the projects' value had been paid to the contractors.NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
The two oil and gas pipelines, as well as a third pipeline that would link the state of Melaka to a refinery and petrochemical plant in the state of Johor, were eventually scrapped.AdvertisementWhile the controversial ECRL was eventually reinstated after intensive renegotiations, other BRI projects continue to remain in limbo.An attempt to restart the multi-billion ringgit Bandar Malaysia fell through earlier in July after the parties involved could not agree on terms to proceed with the project. A source told local daily The Star, however, there is still hope that the project will resume once the epidemic subsides.Bandar Malaysia was due to house the terminal for the now-terminated high-speed rail (HSR) link between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. While the HSR was not directly a BRI project, the railway would have been in line with China's plans for rail links running from Kunming to Singapore.Meanwhile, the prospects are anything but promising for the 43 billion ringgit Melaka Gateway project after the state government cancelled its agreement with KAJ Development, the local developer of the BRI coastal reclamation project, after years of inactivity.The project had long been described as a white elephant, as it included the construction of a mega deepwater port in a nation that already has plenty of existing facilities, as well as hotels, luxury housing, and various tourist attractions.China expert Ngeow Chow Bing of the University of Malaya told South China Morning Post that the termination will unlikely impact Belt and Road cooperation as problems linked to the Melaka Gateway project were unrelated to Malaysia's foreign policy stance. 'It is just a failed project,' he said.At Country Garden Holdings' Forest City, dubbed as the biggest overseas project by a Chinese developer, the company cut its Malaysia staff to 500 as of June this year following three rounds of retrenchments over the last 18 months, from 1,700 in 2019.Enjoying this article?

All of a sudden, international media started picking up on those setbacks and you know, the attention on the initiative turned pretty sour,' Kratz said.Kratz said her dissertation work covering 24 Chinese overseas projects saw two-thirds of the projects being cancelled or shelved, though she did not elaborate. Other recipient countries have opted to either delay or renegotiate some BRI terms amid growing criticism around their sustainability.The COVID-19 pandemic led to further deterioration of fiscal conditions in recipient countries as trade and tourism flows were disrupted by protracted lockdowns, which could lead to a starker slowdown for China's BRI, Kratz said.She said China has to convince recipient countries that accepting Chinese loans will not drive them into a debt crisis.'A lot of what we're seeing at the moment, the debt renegotiation processes that are happening at the moment are putting pressure on China's reputation because everyone likes to receive a loan, everyone likes to you know get a ribbon on a new project, everyone likes to have five years of grace period to be able to get an infrastructure project to work, but no one likes to be asked money back, and no one likes to run into trouble,' Kratz said.An AidData study that looked at 13,427 China-backed projects in 165 countries over 18 years, worth $843 billion in total, found that 35 percent of BRI projects were struggling with corruption, labor violations, environmental pollution, and public protests.AidData said $11.58 billion in projects in Malaysia have been cancelled over 2013-2021, with nearly $1.5 billion cancelled in Kazakhstan and more than $1 billion in Bolivia.China has since taken steps to rebrand the BRI as 'green and clean' through its Digital Silk Road and Health Silk Road. As of October 20 last year, China has provided assistance to 150 countries and seven international organizations and exported over 179 billion masks, 1.73 billion protective suits, and 543 million testing kits, according to President Xi Jinping.Malaysia has benefited from its share of Chinese medical assistance, including the donation of 1.5 million Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine doses. However, the country doesn't seem inclined to return the favor by aligning with or being more favorable toward China – at least not yet.The BRI, as well as increasing pressure driven by the South China Sea dispute, have tested relations between Malaysia and China in recent years. As Ngeow observed, the relationship 'has grown cooler and perhaps more realistic.'With Malaysia too busy dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and stabilizing the domestic political situation, it may take a while before China can once again make the case for the BRI.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;[];https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2021-10-05-6.jpg;False;;18.22194;3098aceeb17dfe422c07f1b34ce1a458;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}
91;TikTok and Beyond: How China's Ascendancy in Digital Technology Challenges the Global Order;;2023-06-02 17:24:00;full;https://thediplomat.com/2023/06/tiktok-and-beyond-how-chinas-ascendancy-in-digital-technology-challenges-the-global-order/;thediplomat.com;"This isn't just a feud between two great powers; it's a competition for a new world order in cyberspace.";"Advertisement
When social media users create and share viral dances and awe-inspiring stunts, they may not be aware that these same digital platforms are at the epicenter of a geopolitical power contest. In particular, the rise of TikTok, a platform owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, has added a new dimension to the complexity of the 'world order.'
The saga of TikTok, which underwent a security review in the United States and made it onto the list of apps banned from government devices in Canada and Australia, underscores developing lines of conflict being drawn around data sovereignty and the necessity for data governance. This isn't just a feud between two great powers; it's a competition for a new world order in cyberspace.
Why TikTok? 
TikTok is essentially a sibling version of Douyin, a video-sharing platform developed by ByteDance. ByteDance started its journey through content aggregation across various internet portals and platforms within China. The company has perfected its AI algorithms to optimally match content with its intended audience, continuously improving the algorithms based on the feedback of almost 1 billion users. On the various ByteDance platforms, content is 'intelligently' pushed toward the audience most likely to appreciate it, creating a potential addiction to the content being presented. Similar algorithms have been implemented on the Douyin platform.

TikTok was established as an independent entity to distance itself from its parent company. It was tested and found successful in Asia, including 
Japan
, a market typically challenging for foreign internet businesses to penetrate and survive. ByteDance's algorithms have revolutionized the traditional social media business model. It has shifted from the model of 'audiences searching for the right content' to 'content searching for the right audiences.' This paradigm shift disrupts the established hierarchy, where content created by more well-known creators is more likely to be found by audiences in their searches.

When TikTok launched in the United States in 2017, it became an immediate market success. In October 2018, 
TikTok
 became the most downloaded app in the United States. Globally, as of 2022, it had achieved 3 billion downloads, and boasted over 1 billion active users each month.
This success story of TikTok hasn't been entirely smooth and its future is still unknown. Under both the Trump and Biden administrations, TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, have been scrutinized for potential national security risks, as critics worry that user data could be accessed by the Chinese government when deemed necessary under Chinese law.
In the context of the larger narrative of great power competition, TikTok exemplifies the dynamics at play. It signifies China's technological prowess and the global impact of its digital innovations. TikTok's saga is more than just a business narrative; it symbolizes the ongoing struggle for a new world order in cyberspace.

A New Territory for Geopolitical Competition
The  pandemic catalyzed a surge in online activities, accelerating the process of 
digital transformation
 as billions of users and devices interconnected online, generating an astronomical amount of data. Increasingly, such data is shared and exchanged across national borders, as global trade moves toward digitized services.
Data has indeed become a crucial resource in the digital economy, with cyberspace quickly emerging as a new arena for human activities, becoming a geopolitical domain akin to land, sea, air, and outer space. However, unlike resources in other geopolitical territories, data can be shared and reused, not adhering to the 'zero-sum' rule of resource competition typically seen in geopolitics. With the advent of cloud-based computing and data storage technologies, traditional jurisdiction based on geography and exclusive jurisdiction over domestic affairs face significant challenges.
Increasingly, competition in cyberspace for influence over the economy, society, and military affairs is redefining the concept of national sovereignty. As demonstrated by the TikTok case, the crux of the issue lies in the uncharted territory of data sovereignty and governance. Currently, there are no clear boundaries for determining data ownership by country. Additionally, strategies for managing privacy, security, and cross-border data flows remain undefined, especially when multiple entities across different nations are involved in data creation. For instance, it's currently unclear who owns the data generated by a Chinese citizen or business in the United States, or vice versa.
The ascent of cyberspace as a new geopolitical domain has disrupted the inherent world order, causing upheavals not just between developed and developing countries, particularly between the United States and China – two major powers in cyberspace – but also between public and private entities.
Uniquely in cyberspace, non-state platform enterprises exert considerable power, often without adequate oversight or accountability. The top five U.S.-based tech titans (Amazon, Alphabet/Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Meta/Facebook) and the top five China-based ones (Huawei, ByteDance, Alibaba/Ant, Tencent, and Baidu) collectively manage over 50 percent of online traffic and dominate the digital infrastructure. These tech behemoths also control research and development in future-defining technologies. Their influence extends beyond technology to society, public opinion, politics, and even geopolitics, further complicating the already complex landscape of data sovereignty and governance.
The United States, the birthplace of the internet, occupies a significant position in the global governance of cyberspace. The U.S. and its Western allies control key resources, including the majority of infrastructure, internet protocols, and standards, as well as the international institutions governing the internet. In terms of soft influence, the U.S.-based tech giants extend globally (except in China), while their Chinese counterparts mainly operate domestically for now. For instance, approximately 
80 percent
 of global netizens use U.S.-based internet browsers, close to 
60 percent
 of online data is in English, and the control of core technologies and user interfaces largely rests with the United States and its allies.

In recent decades, China has emerged as 
the second-largest
 digital economy, accounting for nearly 40 percent of its GDP in 2022, and has begun exporting its digital technologies. Besides TikTok, China's digital apps in social media (e.g., WeChat), e-commerce (e.g., Alibaba and JD.com), and mobile payments (e.g., Alipay) have been adopted overseas, although primarily by Chinese communities.
Uniquely, TikTok stands as the first Chinese app that has significantly penetrated local communities in over 150 countries. Interestingly, however, Chinese citizens cannot access TikTok within mainland China.
Value Clashes
Advertisement
The internet has been built and developed based on network effects – the larger the network, the more utility it provides to its users. In the foreseeable future, the United States and China are expected to continue their domination of cyberspace. However, the rivalry between these two powers extends beyond technology. The competition between their contrasting visions of digital governance encompasses issues such as individual privacy, data security, and the cross-border flow of data.
The prevailing internet governance, led by the United States, adheres to a 
multistakeholder
 approach, which emphasizes the free flow of information and data. This approach is rooted in democratic values and asserts that cyberspace governance should reflect a broad range of perspectives, emphasizing freedom, transparency, and inclusivity. Conversely, China's vision of digital governance advocates for strong state control, based on the principle of '
cyberspace sovereignty
,' whereby each country has the right to regulate the internet within its borders. For instance, China's extensive censorship network, known as the 
Great Firewall
, restricts Chinese netizens' access to many websites and platforms if their servers are not located within China.
China's approach is often interpreted as exporting its authoritarianism, particularly through its 
Digital Silk Road
 via the 
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)
. China has been exporting its digital infrastructure, along with its digital governance model, to BRI member countries. While on the surface, the TikTok situation illuminates national security concerns tied to China's export of its digital technology, it also underscores the potential risks associated with China's approach to data governance.
If these clashes cannot be resolved, China risks being 'marginalized' in cyberspace. For instance, despite different levels of regulations on cross-border data flow and personal privacy protection, the U.S., the EU, and other democratic countries may establish a multilateral system, built on shared values and principles of freedom and human rights protection, governing cross-border data flows in trade, payment, scientific research, while excluding China. This could potentially fragment the global internet and undermine the open, interconnected nature of the digital world.
Emerging Digital Order?
History illustrates that rivalries between great powers over establishing a new world order can have substantial ramifications. In the realm of cyberspace, unlike physical resources such as oil or critical minerals, data, as a virtual entity, doesn't conform to traditional jurisdictional boundaries. This reality has complicated the issues of data sovereignty and data governance, particularly with the rise of advanced digital technologies, such as AI, cloud-based computing and data analytics.
The internet, while having emerged as a vital infrastructure supporting an expanding digital economy, has also pervaded national infrastructures like power grids, transport networks, public health and finance systems. Damage to these systems or data breaches can pose severe threats to national security. Hence, there is a pressing need for a robust global digital order, especially in areas governing data sovereignty and cross-border data flow.
International order acts as a symbol of the progress of human civilization and is crucial in resolving conflicts between nations, as warfare isn't, and shouldn't be, the only means to settle disputes.
TikTok is just one of many digital companies originating from countries where data governance approaches differ significantly from the norms established in the West. It certainly won't be the last. The handling of the TikTok case, and others like it, underscores the importance of cross-country collaboration on key issues. These include cross-border investment, information exchange, data sharing, and particularly the rise of AI.
As the two dominant forces in the digital realm, the United States and China have a particular responsibility in this endeavor. They need to recognize the importance of a global digital order that benefits not just themselves or the current generation, but the entire world and future generations.
Finally, the creation of a digital order isn't merely an issue between the United States and China. It's vital for all nations, irrespective of size, to contribute to the establishment of a new, fair, and inclusive world order in cyberspace. After all, we are all both users and creators of data in this interconnected digital landscape.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat-2020-07-30-3.jpg;False;;18.163168;c0fe1ac16655f0249a93c4450c30d16c;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

Kazakhstani security forces, with the help of troops from Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) allies, put an end to both the peaceful protests and the violent riots that followed them. The political elite around President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev strengthened its hand in an accelerated intra-elite struggle that was intertwined with the unrest, forcing several loyalists around former president Nursultan Nazarbayev out of their posts.While events were confined to Kazakhstan and stemmed from domestic issues, they also had an international dimension. Russia received predominant attention, which focused on the dispatch of around 2,500 CSTO troops. Even after their withdrawal, the Kremlin is said to have proved its effectiveness and gained considerable leverage over Kazakhstan.This has left considerations about Kazakhstan's other powerful neighbor – China – at the sidelines. The absence of the China factor is all the more striking as the increasing Chinese stakes and leverage in Central Asia, and particularly Kazakhstan, have taken center stage in debates ever since its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was announced in the capital of Kazakhstan in 2013. Kazakhstan has since been a linchpin in the megaproject. As unrest has shaken Kazakhstan and political power within the country is shifting, some effects on China-Kazakhstan relations are inevitable.Ties between the two states have focused on the economy. A first wave of Chinese investments, prior to around 2014, was overwhelmingly dedicated to the energy sector. Today, around 20 percent of China's gas imports come from and through Kazakhstan. Another major area has been transport. Volumes of rail cargo – mostly transiting Kazakhstan between China and Europe – have increased impressively each year. An often overlooked but increasingly central pillar of the BRI in Kazakhstan, representing a second wave of investments picking up from 2016, is manufacturing and heavy industry. Kazakhstan and China concluded agreements to shift production capacity out of China and help Kazakhstan diversify its economy. Fifty-five joint projects worth $28 billion are foreseen and have been partially implemented in metallurgy, engineering, chemicals, and other sectors.NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
Neither pipelines nor railways have been affected by the unrest, the Kazakhstani ambassador to China has declared, citing their remoteness from major population centers. The Chengdu-based New Silk Road Intermodal (NSRI) confirmed that operations in Dostyk and Altynkol/Khorgos – the two major cargo terminals at the China-Kazakhstan border – were running smoothly. Air traffic, for which Almaty airport is a major hub, suffered temporary delays and disruptions, and some oil companies were temporarily forced to cut production. To date, however, there have been no reports about potential harm or disruptions to Chinese businesses or citizens in Kazakhstan.Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.As the period of unrest was short, did not entail long strikes, and was focused on (but not limited to) the country's west and Almaty, economic effects were temporary and minimal. It pushed up prices for oil and uranium, though. In the long run and depending on further political and economic events in Kazakhstan, including reform efforts, the events of January 2022 are likely to affect the investment climate.The major reason why Chinese projects were unharmed lies in the fact that the protests did not have a xenophobic or explicitly Sinophobic dimension. This is remarkable since China-skepticism in Kazakhstan is widespread, building on China's potential economic domination and treatment of Muslims – including ethnic Kazakhs – in its Xinjiang region. Kazakh nationalist sentiment is generally considered on the rise. In 2020, southern Kazakhstan witnessed deadly clashes between Kazakhs and members of the Dungan minority, which is of Chinese origin. However, slogans in that vein did not appear in January 2022 and protesters appear not to have been mobilized by such considerations.At the political and inter-governmental level, Chinese officials have voiced concerns about the unrest in Kazakhstan, but to a limited extent and in line with Beijing's official policy of non-interference. As a first official reaction, on January 6, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi declared the protests an internal Kazakhstani affair. On 7 January, Xi Jinping sent a verbal message to Tokayev. Xi praised Tokayev for his reaction, and offered assistance against 'color revolutions,' echoing the Kazakhstani government's framing of the unrest as having been instigated by external powers.AdvertisementAs such, China did not get involved, particularly not with troops. Igor Denisov, writing for The Diplomat, raised another important factor in this regard: China may lack in-depth understanding of intra-elite dynamics and intelligence on events in Kazakhstan, particularly compared to Russia. Chinese isolationism during the pandemic – including among its diplomats abroad – has only contributed to this gap. Accordingly, Beijing is likely to have been taken by surprise both by the unrest and the elite reshuffling in Kazakhstan, adding inability to its unwillingness to get involved. Had border security been compromised, though, China may have militarized and closed its border with Kazakhstan, possibly also citing strict COVID-19 rules.CSTO troops' role in helping to stabilize the situation was likely in line with Beijing's interests, and Chinese officials may have been informed prior. Russia's involvement in Kazakhstan came at the request of its government and not a result of the Kremlin's adventurism and unpredictability, which are not viewed favorably in Beijing. While its intervention strengthened Russia's standing as a security guarantor in the region, lasting and one-sided Kazakhstani dependence on its northern neighbor is unlikely to be a result of it.Stability is Beijing's key interest in Kazakhstan, in order to maintain supply chains, uphold uninterrupted trade flows and cargo transit, and to secure China's western border. Further support for Kazakhstan's regime is likely to occur in the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), an initiative driven by China, in the form of joint exercises, training, and law enforcement cooperation. The member states of the CSTO and the SCO are largely united in their authoritarian style of rule and in their definition of and opposition to terrorism, separatism, and violent extremism.The growing influence of Tokayev and his loyalists at the expense of the old elite around Nazarbayev is unlikely to be opposed by Beijing, if this power struggle is not overtly disruptive, which would threaten stability and Chinese investments. As such, Beijing is unlikely to have a strong preference for a particular Kazakhstani leader, and may lack the necessary intelligence to be a factor in these shifts to begin with. To Beijing, it does not matter too much who is in charge, as long as someone is in charge. Given his international experience and Chinese language skills, Tokayev is likely to be a welcome interlocutor for Beijing.Some (albeit unlikely) alternative governments may pose risks for Chinese interests if they were to build on China-skepticism and Kazakh nationalism. However, by and large, any Kazakhstani government is set to maintain good relations with China. Trade ties with all neighbors, economic diversification, and attracting investments are key to economic growth and to satisfying popular demands in Kazakhstan, which is key to mitigating the risk of further unrest. In this, the regime only succeeds if reforms are genuine, and serious address the issue of inequality.China is poised to maintain and may even increase its crucial position in Kazakhstan in order to foster the country's economic development. The Chinese development model – and Chinese investments – offer the biggest promise for Kazakhstan's economic modernization. Russia or an increasingly reluctant and distant West offer little in that regard. Chinese commentators have indicated the prospect of Chinese economic assistance to Kazakhstan following the unrest. In that, Beijing would pursue its logic of 'stability through development.' While immediate assistance through loans or investments is unlikely and not warranted, the Kazakhstani government may refer to Beijing's offer of support at a later point in time.Were the Tokayev regime to increase repression to quell the potential for further dissent and protests, Russia and China would be obvious partners. Surveillance technology developed and applied in China could be tempting and an element of the diffusion of authoritarian norms and tools. A Chinese commentator with the Global Times has even explicitly suggested applying Beijing's experience in Xinjiang to Kazakhstan. Boosting the use of technological tools would build on their already-rising use in recent years, particularly through the pandemic. As early as 2019, Tokayev instructed the government to follow the Chinese model of digitalization. This has included the use of facial recognition, biometric identification, AI, and video surveillance in cooperation with Chinese tech companies. Through such technologies, China's 'Digital Silk Road' entails a significant political component.Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access.

As a nationalist turn in Kazakhstan or a reorientation of its foreign and economic policy are currently unlikely, China will remain an important – and as Western states and companies may become more hesitant to engage with Nur-Sultan even an inevitable – partner for the Kazakhstani government. Accordingly, even though Kazakhstan will remain adamant about not being overly dependent on its neighbor to the east, China's importance may only grow.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2022-01-20-202958.jpg;False;;17.936935;eba0ab52266466141f382ee4458239f8;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

From July 27-31, a delegation from Georgia, led by Irakli Garibashvili, paid an official visit to China. The visit began with a notably warm welcome at the airport, followed by meetings between Garibashvili and Chinese President Xi Jinping, as well as Premier Li Qiang. Subsequently, China and Georgia jointly announced the elevation of their bilateral ties to a strategic partnership, pledging to bolster policy coordination and alignment in development plans under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and promote two-way trade and investment.
In a joint statement issued by China and Georgia, the two states expressed their intentions to intensify cooperation in various sectors, including transport, telecommunications, infrastructure modernization, digital technologies, manufacturing, railway networks' upgrading and expansion, and environmental protection.
While hosting his Georgian counterpart, Li expressed China's willingness to work closely with Georgia to carry forward their long-standing friendship and enhance strategic communication. Both countries see the establishment of the bilateral strategic partnership as an opportunity to deepen pragmatic cooperation, benefiting their respective nations and peoples.
Additionally, besides the strategic partnership, the countries also signed a bilateral cooperation plan between the governments of China and Georgia within the BRI framework.

Over the years, I have closely observed the developments in China-Georgia relations. In a 2016 
article
 for The Diplomat, I boldly asserted that Georgia had the potential to play a significant role in China's Belt and Road Initiative. Three years later, in another 
article
, I maintained that Georgia could still serve as a hub for China, but only if the BRI survived.

Georgia's unique position as a connector state between the Eurasian interior and Europe has attracted Chinese interest for some time now. Moreover, the ruling Georgian Dream party has shown a favorable attitude toward Chinese leadership. Garibashvili himself expressed warm sentiments in a speech at Peking University in 2015, 
emphasizing that
 'there is no country in the region that is more open to Chinese business and investment, Chinese people and culture or Chinese innovation and ideas than Georgia.'
Despite this diplomatic flirtation and openness, the recent announcement of a strategic partnership between the two countries still came as a significant surprise. It marks a notable milestone in the bilateral relationship and signals a deepening commitment to enhance cooperation and coordination in various sectors, especially within the framework of the BRI.
China-Georgia Relations: The Background
Advertisement
China and Georgia established diplomatic relations in 1992, with China being among the first countries to recognize Georgia's independence. However, at that time, Beijing had limited interests in the region. Trade between the two countries amounted to a mere $3.7 million at the end of the 20th century.
Throughout the 2010s, cooperation between Georgia and China mostly revolved around economic matters. Despite the originally modest trade figures, significant growth occurred in this domain. Initially, Chinese involvement in Georgia was mainly limited to individual projects and credit lines. However, over time, China's presence expanded substantially, establishing itself as a major player in Georgia's economic landscape.
Notable Chinese investments in Georgia include the construction of the Khadori Hydro Power Plant by Sichuan Electric Power Corp China (SEPC). The China Xinjiang Hualing Group became the largest Chinese investor in Georgian mining and timber production. Furthermore, an ambitious 51.6-kilometer section of a Chinese-built highway, featuring 96 bridges and 53 tunnels, is cutting through Georgia's rugged and mountainous terrain, with costs rising to nearly $1 billion.
In 2017, Georgia took significant steps to enhance its economic cooperation with China by signing a Free Trade Agreement, making it the only country in the region with such an agreement with China. This move opened Georgia's market for 96.5 percent of Chinese goods, while China reciprocated by providing duty-free access for Georgian export products, including wine, mineral water, tea, fruits, and more, accounting for 94 percent of goods.
As noted by 
Michael Cecire
, growing Chinese economic influence around the world often goes hand in hand with deepening political engagement. While it may seem puzzling that a country with a population of 4 million and a GDP of just $24.6 billion could become a major interest for the world's second-largest economy, there are other factors driving the Sino-Georgian strategic partnership.
The Middle Corridor in the Spotlight
While Georgia brings some assets to the table, such as its economic potential and natural resources, I believe that the primary aspect that has captured China's attention – and led to the establishment of the Sino-Georgian strategic partnership – is Georgia's strategic location, particularly its significance for the Middle Corridor of the Belt and Road Initiative. The Middle Corridor is a critical component of the BRI, aiming to establish efficient trade routes and transportation links between China, Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Europe. As a connector state situated in the South Caucasus region, Georgia serves as a crucial gateway and transit point for goods moving between these regions.

During the meeting between Garibashvili and Li Qiang, they assessed Georgia's transit potential and emphasized the significance of developing the Middle Corridor. They acknowledged that this corridor's importance had grown even more crucial in light of the current global challenges.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine has resulted in a redirection of trade routes to the Middle Corridor, which encompasses Georgia, Azerbaijan, the Caspian Sea, and Kazakhstan. However, Georgia has yet to fully capitalize on this opportunity.
Following Garibashvili's China visit, discussions surrounding the Middle Corridor have intensified. 'The importance of the Middle Corridor has been talked about for a long time, but today this topic is extremely important for everyone – both for East and West – and the connection of these two markets cannot happen without the Middle Corridor,' Parliament Vice Speaker 
George Volski said
.

'Georgia's geopolitical position corresponds to the standard necessary for the development of the historical Silk Road, and a lot of things will happen through Georgia,' he added.
The Anaklia Port Saga
A critical focal point within the Middle Corridor is Georgia's Anaklia Port, strategically located on the eastern edge of the Black Sea, serving as the shortest route from China to Europe.
Back in 2016, when the Georgian government announced the conclusion of the tender for the construction of the Anaklia deep-water port, the outcome surprised many experts. The contract was not awarded to the most viable bid involving two Chinese companies, Power China–Hubei Hongyuan Power Engineering Company, Ltd, and China Harbour Engineering Company, Ltd, despite the Chinese government's backing. Instead, the winner was the Anaklia Development Consortium, a joint venture between Georgian Group TBC Holding and U.S.-based Conti International.
China was initially seen as the preferred partner, as the construction of the port in Anaklia was explicitly aligned with Beijing's new Silk Road trans-Eurasian transit development policy. However, rumors circulated that the U.S. government played a role in the final decision.
These speculations gained further weight when then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Georgia in 2019 and offered strong support for the Anaklia Project, while also bashing China. 'I communicated our hope that Georgia completes the [Anaklia] port project,' 
Pompeo said
. 'The project and others will enhance Georgia's relationship with free economies and prevent Georgia from falling prey to Russian or Chinese economic influence. Those pretend friends do not have Georgia's best interests at heart.'
However, just a few months following Pompeo's visit, the United States' Conti International withdrew from the Anaklia Development Consortium, and subsequent political controversies and arbitration actions between the government and consortium members led to the abandonment of the project. As a result, no construction progress has been made over the past seven years, leaving the future of the Anaklia port uncertain.
Despite the previous obstacles, some developments have taken place just now. On February 20 of this year, the Ministry of  and Sustainable Development of Georgia made an announcement indicating a new approach to revive the project. They initiated a call for expressions of interest to attract a private partner for a 49 percent stake in the Anaklia Deep Sea Port project, while the state will retain ownership of 51 percent of the shares.
'It should be our task to start the construction of the Anaklia port this year. The construction of roads and highways is underway; we are working on the expansion of the airport and other concepts. So, we have positive developments in all directions,' 
Garibashvili said
.
With the U.S. investor no longer involved, does that mean that China will be awarded the contract this time? And would that mean something more than just an economic partnership?
The Future of China-Georgia Relations
As an absolute majority of Georgians remain supportive of the country's Euro-Atlantic aspirations, it is crucial that Georgia's partnership with China does not engender a shift away from its foreign policy goals. Rather, it should rather serve as a potential solution to certain domestic challenges. However, some concerns arise due to the current foreign policy approach of Georgia's ruling party, which appears to involve criticism of the West while engaging in closer relations with Russia and now China. Additionally, China's position regarding the conflict in Ukraine is not entirely aligned with the international community's stance.

Given these circumstances, the China-Georgia partnership may prompt questions about its broader implications for the country in the South Caucasus. As Georgia seeks economic benefits from cooperation with China, it must carefully navigate potential political ramifications and ensure that its domestic and foreign policies remain aligned with its long-term goals and values.
The Georgian government must strike a delicate balance between leveraging economic opportunities with China while upholding its Euro-Atlantic aspirations and adhering to internationally recognized principles. By doing so, Georgia can harness the potential benefits of the partnership while maintaining its commitment to its broader geopolitical positioning and aspirations. But will Georgia's government be able – and, more importantly, willing – to do that?";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2023-08-04-124244.jpeg;False;;17.924654;49e984b70274f1a31e188005c74885d9;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

Although the exact date of this unofficial Pacific Islands summit has not been announced, the summit appears to be part of the larger U.S. response to an April 2022 framework agreement on security cooperation between China and Solomon Islands.The vaguely worded draft agreement, leaked on social media in March – the final text has not been made public – discussed a deepening of relations between China and Solomon Islands to include the deployment of 'police, armed police, military personnel and other law enforcement and armed forces' at the request of the Solomon Islander government. The security agreement was met with surprise and concern from officials across the Indo-Pacific, especially in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.China's security ambitions, not only in the traditional military realm but also in the digital world, are growing across the Global South. Recently, China tried to deepen security ties, including network governance and cybersecurity, through the failed bid to get Pacific Island states to sign its China-Pacific Island Countries Common Development Vision.To prevent China's party-state from deepening its hold on the digital information ecosystems of the Global South, the U.S. and like-minded democracies need to offer viable digital democratic alternatives.

The German Marshall Fund of the United States' Alliance for Securing Democracy, in conjunction with the International Republican Institute, has released a report titled 'China and the Digital Information Stack in the Global South.' Through five country case studies – Thailand, Myanmar, Uganda, Nigeria, and Jamaica – this report defines the digital information 'stack' and explores how China's party-state exports the digital information stack globally. Through our research, we found that China's party-state works with industry to advance digital information operations related to geostrategic goals far beyond China's shores.Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.Global South countries need to be more aware of the tradeoffs of China's involvement in their digital information stacks. This involvement ranges from Chinese tech companies in the submarine internet cables and 4G and 5G mobile networks of Thailand and Myanmar, to Beijing helping shape ideas on data and cyber sovereignty in Nigeria. Chinese technology companies' equipment is used to spy on domestic political opposition in Uganda. And, lastly, even far more resilient Jamaica has had its leaders express openness to Chinese technology companies' assistance in improving government efficiency and maintaining public safety.We found that even among these diverse countries, facing disparate forms of Chinese involvement, the level of awareness and caution about future Chinese leverage is too low. Regardless of whether a country is a strong democracy like Jamaica or ruled by a repressive military junta like Myanmar, more scrutiny of China's involvement across the digital information stack is necessary.The digital information stack consists of five layers – network infrastructure, devices, applications, content, and governance – and each layer of the stack includes several components. The network infrastructure layer includes physical infrastructure components like submarine and terrestrial cables, telecommunications equipment, and initiatives like the Digital Silk Road. The device layer includes mobile electronics like phones, laptops, and others, as well as Internet of Things devices. The applications layer consists of software, cloud services, social media, and digital payment services. The components of the content layer are the Chinese party-state's messages and narratives, especially Chinese news programming on television and 'Wolf Warrior diplomacy' online. Lastly and most relevant for the Pacific Island countries, the governance layer includes the proliferation of rules, regulations, policies, and standards intended to govern digital spaces and tools.AdvertisementChina's efforts at influencing the governance layer in Global South countries are of particular concern because they frequently involve shaping policy and elite opinion in favor of a state-centric model of cyber governance, in which regimes have broad latitude to control the flow of data and information within their territory. In countries like Thailand and Myanmar, authoritarian governments seek to replicate China's 'Great Firewall,' a system of laws and technological measures that allows the Chinese party-state to shape 1.4 billion people's information space to suit its political preferences. Both Southeast Asian states have passed deliberately all-encompassing cybersecurity laws that emulate the ague and broad nature of China's 2017 Cybersecurity Law. And while the Thai government seems to have backed down from plans to control all digital traffic in and out of the country, Voice of America reported in February 2021 that Chinese technicians were helping the junta set up such a system in Myanmar.In Uganda, Chinese efforts at shaping the governance layer have focused on human capital development, with China deploying extensive training programs at both the popular and elite levels aimed at fostering dependence on, and brand loyalty to, Chinese telecommunications firms like Huawei and ZTE. The programs target not only the technology sector, but also law enforcement, intelligence, military, and other spheres with profound influence over the future of Ugandan technology, surveillance, and censorship policies. Nigeria established the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation, the name of which evokes the EU's GDPR, but the substance of which hews closer to Chinese data policy regulations that focus on state sovereignty over personal data, even when couched in the language of protecting privacy.Jamaica remains an outlier in many ways compared to the other case study countries. Jamaican government officials are wary of allowing Chinese technology companies due to their proximity to the U.S. and fear that Jamaican companies could violate U.S. sanctions and blacklisting laws that target companies like Huawei. Additionally, Jamaica reformed its laws on libel, slander, and defamation, giving it the most freedom of speech and expression out of the five countries examined in this report. However, Jamaica shows that China can continue to make inroads with countries that have robust democratic institutions. Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness expressed on a trip in 2019 to China that learning how to develop Jamaica's ICT infrastructure is a priority of the Jamaican government, and that equipment from Chinese technology companies like Huawei could play a role in maintaining public order, fighting crime, and improving government efficiency.Looking at these five countries, we found several ways that the U.S. and like-minded democracies could assist Global South countries like those in the Pacific Islands when China proposes agreements like the China-Pacific Island Countries Common Development Vision and bilateral deals like the one with Solomon Islands. The U.S. and partners should bolster the efforts of Global South countries to monitor China's influence, especially agreements and deals tied to ICT companies. Similarly, these efforts could be used to improve legislative oversight of Chinese ICT companies and other entities seeking involvement in a host country's digital information stack. And lastly, the U.S. and like-minded partners should offer support for developing and maintaining protected communication channels through initiatives like the Open Technology Fund.In conclusion, to be viable alternatives to countries across the Global South seeking to improve their digital information stacks, the U.S. and like-minded democracies need to use the full range of tools available to seek more transparency from ICT companies tied to the Chinese party-state. That way, these countries appreciate the full scope of the agreements they enter into and can avoid the privacy, public safety, and data security pitfalls they often entail.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2021-07-22-13.jpg;False;;17.862507;db98a341f3961be9d7372e3d27f2ef68;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}
95;Big Ideas From Recent Trends in China's Data Governance;;2023-01-09 16:15:00;timezone unknown;https://thediplomat.com/2023/01/big-ideas-from-recent-trends-in-chinas-data-governance/;thediplomat.com;A look at the direction of China's data governance – and, by extension, the future of its digital economy.;"AdvertisementData will define China. Ever since the State Council enshrined data as a factor of production alongside land, labor, capital, and technology in 2020, the importance of regulating digital information has only continued to grow. Three big ideas have emerged in recent years: First, how China intends to leverage data to drive its economy. Second, the nuances behind increasingly intense data protection enforcement and an accountability blind spot in favor of public bodies, including questions over the Cyberspace Administration of China's mandate. Finally, the potential influence Chinese data governance ideals have on foreign governments that have become increasingly reliant on the former.Leveraging Data as a Factor of Economic ProductionChina's 14th Five-Year Plan for National Informatization (the 14th FYP), likely the world's first industrial policy for the digital era, endeavors to 'activate the factor value of data' to 'shape a strong domestic market that is innovation-driven [and] high-quality.' This should be read together with top leader Xi Jinping's directives on economic development, which espoused the need to 'regulate amidst development and develop amidst regulation.' Accordingly, China's digital economy will rely on data not as a raw resource to be exploited by the free market, but as a regulated commodity subject to close government oversight.There is an underlying belief that data should be directed to economic agents who can maximize the productivity of data. For one, the proactive disclosure of government data for commercial/public use has been gaining traction. China revised its Open Government Information Regulations in 2019 to maximize 'the role of government information in… the people's production and… economic and social activities.'NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
At the provincial level, the Guangdong government has prohibited its offices from preventing the open utilization of public data and instituted the first-of-its-kind Chief Data Officer system to oversee such initiatives.Enjoying this article?

Data has been likened to a semi-public good – non-rivalrous in that multiple actors can 'consume' data without affecting its stores, but excludable in that some parties, such as incumbent firms with large data reserves, would have limited incentives to share them with competitors.State intervention could be a catalyst in the early stages. One notable effort toward commoditizing and sharing data was the establishment of the Shanghai Data Exchange (SDE) in November 2021. This quasi-government corporation positions itself as China's largest platform for businesses to buy and sell data with one another.Government influence similarly cannot be understated for private firms. Ant, which is enroute to becoming a People's Bank of China-supervised financial holding company, has promised to share all its Huabei consumer credit data with the PBOC, notwithstanding that Ant's billion-user database has been a 'key competitive advantage for the company.'AdvertisementLegal instruments are also important in providing clarity around the implications of data sharing. Whereas the SDE was wary of challenges surrounding the standardization of data formats and data protection compliance (among others), the Shanghai Data Regulation was passed to provide legal basis and clarity for the SDE's operations. More fundamental regulations were released later – such as the draft National Information Security Technology Network Data Classification and Grading Requirements of September 2022 – to facilitate the standardization of data classification and grading rules across the industry.Enforcement of Data Regulations: The Private/Public DisconnectThe 14th FYP recognizes that China's private tech firms shall drive all aspects of national informatization, with the caveat that the ministries will 'grasp promotion, development, supervision, management… with both hands – and both hands must be strong…' This expressly empowers the government to rein in the tech market, and by extension some of the most influential data handlers.In February 2022, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) released an enforcement guidance that reiterated its campaign against illegal internet activity, within which platform companies were mentioned around a dozen times. By July, the Didi case had broken records as the nation's largest-ever data protection penalty, a total of $1 billion shared among the company, CEO, and president.But there is a glaring omission in the CAC's enforcement: Public bodies have not been held to the same standards for data protection as private ones. This is despite the presence of large-scale data breaches that government bodies have been guilty of. In July, more than 1 billion individuals' personal information held by the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) in Shanghai was disclosed and put up for sale. A month later, Shanghai's health QR code system was hacked and 48.5 million individuals' personal information was put up for sale. However, no official explanations were given and discussions on local social media were taken down.Ironically, the MPS is one of the authorities jointly responsible for data protection alongside the CAC – it would be interesting to see how such top regulators regulate themselves.Amid such risks, government-controlled data remain ever-important. Shenzhen's new AI Industry Promotion Regulations require the establishment of a public data system, while Xi has promised to double down on building a digital government. Therefore, the need to hold government bodies accountable for data handling has never been more pronounced.Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.That said, it is questionable whether the CAC is up for this task, not least because the very mandate of the administration is mysterious. The CAC has no clear designation regarding whether it is a state (administrative) or Communist Party entity, and how this affects its functions and accountability. Although the CAC has been assigned administrative functions by the State Council (e.g. investigating and penalizing Didi), it has been formally placed under the CCP Central Committee ever since China's 2018 government reshuffle.As a party entity, the CAC is exempt from administrative law and other agency-regulating rules. As an administrative entity, the CAC's signature moves against Didi and mobile apps have occurred with unprecedented legal authority. It is no easy task to predict what it thinks about enforcement against its sister organs (e.g. the MPS) from the public sector, or if that even is a priority at all.International InfluenceAdvertisement'Building a community with a shared future in cyberspace' has been Xi's overarching internet governance goal since 2015. In November 2022, the State Council published a white paper to propound 'multilateral and multiparty participation and consultation' in global internet governance, and highlight China's role in 'in strengthening international cooperation in protecting critical information infrastructure and data security.'Instead of unilaterally prescribing formal legal standards for other governments, China has made significant strides in building a shared 'community' under a brand of collaboration via, for instance, the China-ASEAN Digital Cooperation Forum and the World Internet Conference (WIC). But beyond branding and outreach, a creeping 'Beijing Effect' portends the growing global influence of Chinese data governance ideals.The Beijing Effect is built upon the Brussels Effect, which posits that law – for example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) – may have regulatory effects outside its jurisdiction of origin. Notwithstanding whether a GDPR-esque globalization of Chinese data protection laws would occur, the Beijing Effect is essentially different than the Brussels Effect because it is not about dispersing formal law. In particular,  the Chinese version entails a confluence of broader extralegal factors such as the foreign governments' demand for technological standard-setting and digital infrastructure.First, Chinese actors play an increasingly important role in setting international standards for digital technology. The Made in China 2025 plan, which seeks to ensure the country's self-reliance in advanced technology sectors, has seen companies like Huawei rallying the development of global 5G standards across major markets including Africa and Europe. China's Global Data Security Initiative (GDSI), which seeks calls for governmental consensus on 'standards and rules of the global digital field' including cross-border data transfers, data security etc., has been endorsed by ASEAN, the Arab League and several other countries.Second, with China's Digital Silk Road, Chinese companies provide digital infrastructures for host countries, thereby shaping the conditions under which those countries transition toward their own digital economies. Made in China 2025 proposes for China to command a 60-percent share in the global fiber optics market, also a crucial component of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which is in turn the largest component of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Since 2020, China has been supporting cloud developments in its BRI partner countries – for instance, Alibaba penned a deal with Saudi Arabia's largest telecoms group to build the kingdom's cloud infrastructure in that year.The supply of digital infrastructure depends heavily on Chinese companies, which are effectively overseen by the party-state. State-owned enterprises dominate the majority of BRI projects. Thus, when it comes to the development of domestic legal frameworks to deal with concerns over data privacy in the fiber/cloud business or broader economic goals, Beijing's directives would be implicitly transmitted via their foreign corporate representatives.ConclusionData has already started to define China. Faced with China's stagnating economy, Xi is betting on the data-driven economy for a new lease of life. Regardless of his domestic woes, China's international influence as a director of foreign development cannot be discounted.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat-china-flag-cyber2.jpg;False;;17.579515;41e78d06d5ce5fbdc15af668026154ba;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}
96;China-Russia Cooperation in Africa and the Middle East;;2023-04-03 02:45:00;timezone unknown;https://thediplomat.com/2023/04/china-russia-cooperation-in-africa-and-the-middle-east/;thediplomat.com;Africa and the Middle East provide conducive conditions for China and Russia to advance their shared and separate agendas.;"Advertisement
Beijing aspires to restore China's centrality in the global system. Moscow aims to achieve Russia's revanchist agenda at all costs. In attempting to reconfigure the international rules-based order, China's paramount leader Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are positioning China as a rule-maker, system-shaper, and standard-setter. As disrupter, spoiler, and saboteur in upending global order, Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin seek to revive Russia's relevance as a great imperial power. 
Together, China and Russia are undermining U.S. leadership and challenging NATO. Beijing and Moscow understand that exploiting intra-EU friction is pivotal in eroding transatlantic solidarity. As war fatigue mounts, a divided U.S.-EU relationship would weaken NATO – a key variable in the China-Russia geostrategic calculus. 
Russia's war on Ukraine has magnified the core elements of China-Russia cooperation: target the United States as the main instigator of NATO's eastward expansion; criticize the complicity of the EU and other U.S. allies; amplify each other's 
mantra
 of 'respect for the sovereignty of all countries'; suppress domestic debate about the war among Chinese and Russian citizenry; systematically spread disinformation; and promulgate Sino-Russian leadership as an alternative geopolitical center of gravity.  
Beijing and Moscow are empowering each other to mask deep mutual, strategic distrust. As junior partner to China, Russia relies on China's economic, financial, and technological support, knowing that Beijing aims to eclipse Moscow's geopolitical influence in Central Asia, Russia's backyard, and in the Global South. China's superior stature in this relationship lends Beijing leverage to legitimize China's anti-U.S. agenda with Russia's imprimatur. Even a Russia vilified by the wealthy West can be useful to Beijing in elevating China's rising stature across the Global South, where Russia is still regarded as a strong and influential nuclear power.

This great power rivalry between the U.S.-EU-led liberal, democratic world order and China-Russia-charged autocratic alternative is unfolding with far-reaching scope, scale, and stakes in the Global South, an intermediate zone where countries' national interests are driving their hedging strategies vis-à-vis the West and anti-West. As two critical regions with vast natural resources and diverse strategic interests, Africa and the Middle East provide conducive conditions – autocratic governance, restricted media, authoritarian capitalism, surveillance states, weak rule of law, etc.  ̶   for China and Russia to advance their shared and separate agendas.

Africa: A Gravitational Shift from West to East
Russia and China are pursuing different strategies toward Africa but share a convergent goal of bolstering authoritarian regimes and undermining U.S. and European influence on the continent. Through commercial, financial, and military engagement, China and Russia aim to accelerate a gravitational shift in Africa from the West to the East. 
The voting power of China and Russia as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council is a highly effective tool in projecting their cooperation on votes and vetoes that serve their mutual interests. Through hard and soft power, Beijing and Moscow engage the voting power of 
Africa's 54 countries, which compose the largest single voting bloc in the U.N. General Assembly.

Through the BRICS bloc – Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa – Beijing and Moscow are bolstering regional hegemon South Africa, as displayed at the Exercise Mosi-2 maritime exercises in the Indian Ocean recently conducted with the South African, Chinese, and Russian navies. 
Beijing's multilateral approach, which includes its Belt and Road Initiative, Global Development Initiative, and Global Security Initiative, extends China's infrastructure investment, capacity building, and regional security engagement as platforms to propagate China's model of governance in the Global South, including Africa and the Middle East.
The countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) – a trillion-dollar mega infrastructure development platform launched in 2013 as the centerpiece of Xi Jinping's foreign policy  ̶  span all continents, with approximately 147 in total under various types of cooperation agreements. Despite Western concerns that the BRI creates a debt trap for developing countries, the initiative continues to progress in the Global South. 
Seventy-four percent of the world's countries have signed on to the BRI as of 2022, with 94 percent of sub-Saharan African countries having signed on and 85 percent of the countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), according to 
AidData
. Forty-three
 BRI countries are in sub-Saharan Africa and 18 are in MENA.
 
Beijing 
initiated
 the Global Development Initiative (GDI) at the U.N. General Assembly in 2021 in order to galvanize a global community of development through implementation of the U.N.'s 2030 Agenda. The GDI Group of Friends consists of more than 60 countries. GDI cooperation projects have received support from the Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund. 
The BRI and GDI operate on parallel tracks with clear and complementary differences, as the Development Policy Centre 
delineates
: 
While the BRI is economic growth oriented, the GDI is development oriented. The BRI delivers hardware and economic corridors, while the GDI focuses on software, livelihoods, knowledge transfer, and capacity building. The BRI is market oriented, where enterprises play a key role. While the BRI's pathways are mostly bilateral and regional, involving MOUs with partner countries, the GDI promotes diverse partnerships with multilaterals, NGOs, and the private sector. 
Africa also features prominently in China's Global Security Initiative (GSI), the CCP's blueprint for integrating China's security priorities and practices into like-minded stakeholder-countries' national security systems. Using the U.N. aegis, Beijing is promoting China as a 
primus inter pares 
dispute arbiter, architect of new regional security frameworks, and trainer of security professionals and police forces in developing countries. Involvement in multilateral platforms, such as the African Union, Silencing the Guns in Africa, China-Horn of Africa Peace, Governance and Development Conference, China-Africa Peace and Security Forum, and the Secretary-General's Peace and Security Sub-Fund of the China-U.N. Peace and Development Trust Fund, etc. gives agency to CCP personnel at all levels of leadership to advance China's agenda.

Russia's approach to Africa is more specialized. Russia's military support, energy security exploits, minerals mining, and elite political co-optation sustains strongman political culture in various African countries but has a destabilizing 
impact
 on other African societies. 
Russia provides 49 percent of Africa's military equipment, including major and small arms. Main importers include Algeria, Angola, Burkina Faso, Egypt, Ethiopia, Morocco, and Uganda. The United States holds 37 percent market share of weapons exports to Africa, with Russia holding 20 percent.
 Current sanctions on Russia and global supply chain disruptions have likely opened avenues for alternative and black-market arms suppliers in Africa.    
According to Professor Janos Besenyo, head of Africa Research Institute at Obuda University, Russian energy companies have significant 
investments
 in Algeria's oil and gas industries as well as investments in Libya, Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Egypt. The Coordinating Committee for Economic Cooperation with sub-Saharan Africa promotes Russian business interests across the continent.   
Middle East: Regional Dynamics Optimize China-Russia Cooperation 
Advertisement
The convergence of Chinese and Russian strategies in MENA, including the eastern Mediterranean 
region
, poses an ongoing geostrategic challenge to the West and NATO's southern flank. MENA regional dynamics are optimal for China and Russia to embolden Iran, capitalize on Saudi Arabia-Iran rivalry, and compel U.S. ally Israel to hedge against great power competition.  
In the geopolitics of petro-powers, China is the net beneficiary of discounted Russian oil and consumer of Saudi Arabian and Iranian energy sources. Saudi Arabia supplies 70 percent of China's oil and 40 percent of its natural gas. China's imports of Iranian oil reached 1.2 million bpd in 2022, a 130 percent increase from 2021, and will continue to increase. 
 
China's BRI and GSI's integration of its civil-military fusion commercial, technological, and surveillance capabilities into MENA countries' infrastructure development plans will gradually undercut Moscow's leverage and maximize Beijing's ability to shape MENA's geopolitical landscape to China's advantage.
China's foreign policy approach in the Middle East reflects Xi Jinping's great power diplomacy with Chinese characteristics model. China's primary comprehensive strategic partnerships include five MENA countries: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE, and Israel. 
China has been the Arab world's leading trade partner since 2020, surpassing $330 billion in two-way trade since 2021. In addition to signing a 25-year agreement with Iran in 2021, China has similar agreements with 12 Arab MENA countries. The Suez Canal, Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Bab al-Mandab, Strait of Hormuz, and Indian Ocean are key waterways and chokepoints of China's Maritime Silk Road, interlinking Africa and MENA with Asia through maritime shipping 
routes.
  
Chinese stakes in Mediterranean 
ports
, including Piraeus, Genoa, Trieste, Taranto, Haifa, Ashdod, Djibouti, and Sokhna, facilitate China's expanding surveillance and intelligence-collection efforts through commerce.  
China's three top port operators  ̶  China Merchants Port Holdings, COSCO Group, and China Shipping Terminal Development 
 ̶  are Chinese state-owned enterprises. ZPMC, one of the world's largest ship-to-shore crane manufacturers and subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company, a state-owned enterprise and contractor for BRI projects, embeds surveillance technology in their cranes, 
according
 to the Pentagon.
MENA is an integral region in China's BRI and GSI. Iraq was the region's top recipient of BRI funding ($10.5 billion) in 2021. Through the BRI, Chinese state-owned enterprises have contributed to myriad MENA 
projects
 in smart city grids, 4G and 5G communications, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, collaboration on BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, and the Green Silk Road of new energy, among others. The BRI is also supporting the Vision 2030 plans of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt.  
Through the GSI, China intends to establish a new security framework in the Middle East with the support of the League of Arab States.  With a military base in Djibouti, China is reportedly exploring Bahrain, Iran, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen as possible sites for new bases. China is assisting Saudi Arabia in establishing its first drone factory and with Riyadh's domestic development of ballistic missiles. China has also sold planes, drones, and missiles to the armies of the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Turkey, Morocco, and Algeria, according to an Atlantic Council Report (2023). Iran will become an official member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which is co-led by China and Russia, in April 2023.   
China-Russia cooperation represents a tactical alliance that serves China's long-term strategic advantage. MENA's tribal and autocratic political culture is conducive for Moscow and Beijing to coalesce an authoritarian counterweight to the West. China and Russia in cooperation with Iran are galvanizing autocratic grievances against Western democracy. With Ukraine as the focal point of the current conflict in Europe and Taiwan as the fulcrum in a plausible future conflict in the Indo-Pacific, Israel will most likely be the crucible of confluence between geostrategic and historical forces in the MENA and eastern Mediterranean. 
Countervailing Narrative: Discourse Power, Digital Governance, and Data Security 
China and Russia are closely coordinating in propagating an anti-West and anti-democracy narrative to challenge U.S. and Western primacy in the global rules-based order. This countervailing narrative – mainly from Beijing with Moscow's amplification – manifests China's 'discourse power.' 
According to Lu Wei:

National discourse 
power
 is the influence of a country's 'speech' in the world… National discourse power and information security are closely connected and inseparable. Without discourse power, it will not be possible to realize sustainable information security in the true sense of the world; without information security, it is also not possible to have strong and effective discourse power.
Lu Wei formerly served as vice director of Xinhua News Agency, China's official state-run media organ, and then as minister of the Beijing Propaganda Department and head of the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) during its first three years of existence (2014-2016). Under the jurisdiction of the CCP, CAC serves as the primary regulator, censor, and administrator of China's internet apparatus and policy. 
China's national discourse power essentially propagates the CCP's worldview, in which China plays a central role in rewriting international rules, shaping the global system to advance China's national interests, and setting standards in digital governance and data security as well as telecommunications, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and other advanced technologies. 
China also uses national discourse power to repudiate the West's 'prevalent discourse,' which often contains 'latent discursive hegemony, depriving other countries of the right to speak, to say even less about their discursive power,' 
according to
 Lu Wei.  
In the battle between China's national discourse power and the West's prevalent discourse, Russia's discourse power capabilities augment China's messaging with additive disinformation and distortion. Their shared strategy is both to capture 'hearts and minds' in Global South societies and embolden the discourse power of authoritarian and illiberal regimes in these regions. Much of China and Russia's work has taken place within the Group of Government Experts on the Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, according to the Center for a New American Security

97;Serdar Berdimuhamedov and Turkmenistan's Digital Transformation;;2021-07-20 14:00:00;timezone unknown;https://thediplomat.com/2021/07/serdar-berdimuhamedov-and-turkmenistans-digital-transformation/;thediplomat.com;As the Turkmen president's son continues his tour of top government positions, digitalization remains a critical priority for the regime.;"AdvertisementOn February 12, 2021, Serdar Berdimuhamedov was given a number of top positions by his father, Turkmenistan's President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov. The appointments ushered in the penultimate stage of a hereditary power transition that has been underway for several years now. Serdar was appointed the head of the Supreme Control Chamber, a member of the State Security Council, and more importantly the post of deputy chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers (Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov is the chairman), responsible for the implementation of the country's digitalization policy and integration of innovative technologies in the economy, public governance and social spheres. In the following months, Serdar enjoyed a further expansion of his political influence, becoming a chair of the Turkmen-Japanese as well as (and more importantly) the Turkmen-Russian and Turkmen-Chinese intergovernmental cooperation commissions, and the head of the Ashgabat-based International Association of Akhal-Teke Horse Breeding. Regarding the latter, President Berdimuhamedov's obsession with Akhal-Teke horses is not a mere hobby but a state matter. It has been an important feature of Turkmenistan's nation-building project, and also signifies his native tribe's dominant position in the country's sociopolitical system. Serdar's appointments altogether make him the second-most powerful political figure in the country, in charge of strategically important domestic political projects and foreign policy initiatives, especially in light of the power transition scheme and the country's ambitious digitalization endeavor.Digitalization has been high on President Berdimuhamedov's agenda since late 2018, when he adopted the Concept of the Development of Digital Economy in Turkmenistan for 2019-2025. In February 2021, the document was supplemented by the new State Program on the Development of the Digital Economy of Turkmenistan for 2021-2025. Berdimuhamedov senior presents digitalization as a matter of safeguarding national sovereignty. He has articulated its objectives as the modernization of state governance through rationalization of bureaucratic costs and improvement of the efficiency of state institutions and state-affiliated enterprises, as well as diversification of the country's economic portfolio, currently overly dependent on hydrocarbons as the source of revenue. Given the protracted socioeconomic crisis that Turkmenistan has been experiencing for at least the past five years, which has significantly deteriorated living conditions for the population at large, it certainly appears as a timely and reasonable policy measure. When properly administered, digitalization does yield significant economic and social benefits for the public; however, in Turkmenistan's case, digitalization is as opaque a business as any other matter of the state.This is not to say that the country has not attained some progress in this policy area; the number of state bodies having their own websites is growing, and so is the number of financial institutions that provide online banking services. According to MasterCard, in 2020 the volume of non-cash transactions in Turkmenistan was 2.65 times higher than in the same period of 2019; the number of internet banking subscribers rose to 634,000 people, while the number of customers using mobile banking reached 28,400 in 2021. The country's internet penetration rate is also on the rise, according to DataReportal. Between 2020 and 2021, the number of internet users in Turkmenistan increased by 459,000, bringing the country's internet penetration rate to 33.2 percent. Nevertheless, the current progress has been mainly perfunctory, reflecting the government's prioritization of meeting easily-achievable quantifiable targets as indicators of progress, such as those above, with lesser consideration given to the issues of quality and functionality. State bureaucrats rush to launch websites and platforms to avoid a presidential reprimand, which results in many of these platforms having outdated information and limited functional capacity. They are of little use to the public and business community. To make matters worse, the government neglects the introduction of much-needed, far-reaching reforms aimed at eradicating the underlying problems, including the societal digital divide, the knowledge and skills gap, and the lack of a competitive business environment. For instance, although the government recently slashed the price for internet access from 150 manat ($42.6 at the official rate, roughly $5 at the black market rate) to 100 manat for 256 kbps connections, and from 350 manat to 200 manat for 2 mbps connections, these prices still remain unaffordable to the majority of the population, given the enormous loss in purchasing power due to the economic crisis.Enjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.The absence of meaningful progress is the result of not only low management capacity at the state institutions tasked with implementing the digitalization drive, but also of the different view of digitalization and its utility at the very top, which places the potential positive benefits for the general public at the bottom of policy priorities. For Berdimuhamedov senior, digitalization, apart from strengthening state institutions, is largely a vanity political project aimed at boosting his and Serdar's image as modernizing and forward-looking technocrats, for both domestic and international audiences, in step with current global trends. In 2019, for instance, Akhal region, then under Serdar's leadership, reportedly became the country's first region to fully integrate e-document workflows in its public governance system. In October 2020, Serdar, then the minister of industry, presented his father with a number of electronic and household appliances, such as smart TVs and smartphones, which he claimed had been produced in Turkmenistan. In the capacity of deputy chairman, Serdar has put efforts into strengthening cooperation in high tech fields with Russia and China, inviting them to participate in the country's ambitious 'smart city' project.The other aspect of digital transformation that looks equally appealing to Berdimuhamedov is its potential of generating wealth for his extended family network. Digitalization requires the allocation of significant investments in developing the requisite ICT infrastructure and procurement of hardware and services. In Turkmenistan, such projects almost always have inflated costs for the purpose of siphoning off state funds and are carried out by companies connected to the president's close relatives and confidants, as is the case with the companies building the Ashgabat-Turkmenabat highway at a cost of $2.3 billion. NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
Last, but not least, the digitalization drive seeks to enhance state surveillance capabilities and thus government control of the population. Ashgabat is particularly committed to improving these capabilities and strengthening cooperation with Russia and China in that pursuit. Though always a priority for Turkmen leadership, this area has gained utmost importance in light of rising Turkmen activism online in recent years. An increasing number of activists, both at home and abroad, have been posting content critical of the government, exposing mismanagement, the negligence of worsening socioeconomic conditions, and inadequate responses to emergency situations. The spread of the coronavirus pandemic in the country in 2020 and the fumbled response to a hurricane that hit the eastern province, inflicting severe damage, are two key examples. These developments fueled a wave of anti-government protests staged by Turkmen studying and living abroad, and even some smaller-scale protests inside the country. AdvertisementTo keep political discontent from gaining ground and jeopardizing the power status quo, the government has responded by establishing a network of 'digital security departments' in almost every state and state-affiliated body; intensifying attacks on VPN applications and their users; intimidating activists and their families through a bundle of online and offline measures; improving the state's capacity to keep the population in an 'information vacuum'; and disrupting internet services, especially during emergency situations, to prevent seepage of information about the government's mismanagement.Realizing its limitations in technology and skills, Ashgabat has intensified cooperation with Russia to satisfy its growing requirements. The two countries signed an agreement on cooperation in information security back in 2019, sharing a vision of 'sovereign internet,' which grants the state  excessive oversight powers under the pretext of securing public order. Serdar, in the capacity of chair of the Turkmen-Russian commission, has arguably taken this partnership a step further. In his meetings with Russian officials, namely with Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and the Deputy Chairman of Russia's Security Council Dmitriy Medvedev, among others, cooperation in security and high tech fields received great attention. These fields were reflected as priorities in a new program on Russian-Turkmen intergovernmental economic cooperation for 2021-2023 that Serdar presented to his father in May, and which he approved and ordered Serdar to supervise.Although cooperation with China in this area is currently less pronounced, it is likely to intensify in the years to come. Turkmenistan undoubtedly keeps a close eye on how such cooperation benefits the ruling regimes in neighboring countries. Chinese companies, namely Huawei, engaged in such projects have also been recurring guests in Ashgabat's innovative technologies-focused exhibition Turkmentel.At the time of writing of this article, Serdar Berdimuhamedov was relieved of his duties heading the Supreme Control Chamber and being a member of the State Security Council. He was, instead, appointed deputy chairman overseeing economy, banking, and liaising with international financial institutions. He additionally became Turkmenistan's representative to the Economic Council of the Commonwealth of Independent States, and was put in charge of overseeing the Balkan region. These appointments do not necessarily mean that Serdar's engagement with the country's digitalization endeavor has come to a halt. With succession looming on the horizon and him retaining core positions for cooperation with Russia and China, with which partnership in high-tech issues will most likely continue to intensify, his engagement with this policy area may be taking a different turn but not ceasing. The extent to which he is genuinely interested in and committed to this policy area, if at all, is another question with no clear answer as of now. Despite this, it is most likely that Serdar, just like his father, will continue to make it to the headlines of local newspapers with digitalization-related success stories. After all, if to take the state propaganda's messaging at face value, digitalization projects suit him so well, the same way Alabay sheepdogs, Akhal-Teke horses, and most importantly, his father's 'throne' do. This article is loosely based on the author's article on Turkmenistan's digitalization strategy written for the 'Digital Silk Road in Central Asia: Present and Future' report prepared by Davis Center (Harvard University) and the Sustainable Kazakhstan Research Institute (Narxoz University).";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;[];https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2021-07-20-6.jpg;False;;15.399194;6155842ef1f40d5b2734a17dab21f322;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

Based on dozens of interviews with Uyghur exiles, the book illuminates how the Chinese government has pioneered a series of law enforcement and surveillance techniques, including data-enabled 'preventive policing,' which have funneled hundreds of thousands into 're-education camps' and brought the region close to the reality depicted in George Orwell's '1984.'Cain spoke with The Diplomat's Sebastian Strangio about the genesis of the Chinese government's 'slow, sinister erasure' of Uyghur culture, the complicity of Western tech firms, and the texture of daily life under the Party's unblinking eye.As your book reveals, the ethnic minorities of Xinjiang refer to the region's regime of pervasive surveillance as 'the situation.' What does 'the situation' mean in practical terms for the average Uyghur or Kazakh? How and where does this system intersect with people's everyday routines?When Uyghurs and Kazakhs say 'the situation,' they're using a euphemism and codeword for all the surveillance that envelopes their daily lives. You can live your entire life in Xinjiang under the watch of the state.Of course, other regimes have attempted this before. But what makes life in Xinjiang so foreboding is that the police have seized on new advances in artificial intelligence, deep neural networks, facial and voice recognition, and biometric data collection to establish the all-seeing eye. Every person in Xinjiang is documented down to their genetic makeup, the sound of their voice, and whether they enter their homes through the front door or the back.Enjoying this article?

We live in an age where the unprecedented pace of technological advance has collided with the rise of authoritarians, strongmen, and major technology corporations with the muscle to overpower, or the cash piles to buy off, sovereign states. It's a dangerous mix, and not one we should rule out coming to stable democracies in the West, too.What was the genesis of the 'perfect police state' in China? Why did the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) embark on this far-reaching project, and what is its ultimate goal?NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
Under the CCP, Xinjiang was always a far-off and restive region, with its own identity, language and culture distinct from the Han Chinese majority. And so Xinjiang was always the site of repression at the hands of the CCP, fearful that the region could break off and form its own nation. It's what happened in the Soviet Union after its own collapse, with the creation of the states of Central Asia, such as Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.AdvertisementChina was also concerned about terrorism in the region of Xinjiang – a small, radical segment of the population was bent on launching terrorist attacks against China. In 1996, China set up the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and signed up Central Asian nations for its mission to deter terrorist attacks and maintain security in the oil-rich regions of Eurasia. But it wasn't until September 11, 2001 that China had a new impetus, a shield of 'counterterrorism' with which to cover its repression of Xinjiang from criticism.Ultimately, China's goal was to create a total security state. It wanted to monitor, document, and surveil every square meter and every person in Xinjiang, buying its own propaganda that the region was teeming with terrorists. As one Chinese official in Xinjiang put it: 'You can't uproot all the weeds hidden among the crops in the field one by one – you need to spray chemicals to kill them all.' It sums up the CCP's approach the region.One strategy for creating a total security state is the absolute assimilation of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslim minorities – about 12 million people – into the ways of life of the Han Chinese majority.This isn't a genocide in the sense of the twentieth century, when fascist bureaucracies marched 'unwanted' populations to death camps and forced them into gas chambers. This is the slow, sinister erasure of an entire culture, through psychological and physical torture at concentration camps, and never-ending surveillance that forces them to internalize the state's thinking and deny their own realities.It's also the generational erasure of the population through forced sterilizations of women. By that token, under international law, China has committed genocide against the people of Xinjiang.In your book, you describe the sheer pervasiveness of the surveillance state in Xinjiang, from the ubiquitous CCTV cameras to the use of data and algorithms in 'preventive policing,' which have collectively brought the region into the realm of that described in Orwell's '1984.' Can you give us a summary of what tools the Chinese government is using to police the minority populations of Xinjiang?In addition to '1984,' life in Xinjiang reminds me of the Tom Cruise film 'Minority Report,' based on the short story by the sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick, who also wrote the classic book that inspired 'Bladerunner.'Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access.

If the system believes you will commit a crime in the future, for whatever arbitrary reason, you're in danger of getting a visit from the police and being taken to one of hundreds of known concentration camps. Without being charged with a crime, you'll be brainwashed into 'cleansing' your mind of 'ideological viruses' and 'cancers.' That's literally the language that the Xinjiang authorities use.For China to build its all-seeing surveillance state, it needed new advances in technology that converged around the same time period. The first was the hardware switch from the old analog CCTV cameras of the 1990s and early 2000s, and the shift to digital, where China led the way with state-run firms like Hikvision, the world's largest maker of surveillance cameras.The second breakthrough covered the interconnected fields of deep neural nets, facial recognition, and voice recognition in the early 2010s. New AI software had abandoned old algorithms and could now learn and train its own algorithms from vast amounts of data, gathered through cameras, clicks and purchases. Microsoft, Amazon and Chinese firms Megvii and SenseTime led the way, eager to monitor customers under the profit motive.AdvertisementDo you think the CCP's anathematization of Islam is a product of its ideology and history, or does it also reflect older patterns of interaction between the Chinese state and the empire's Muslim populations?I think the approach to Islam within its own borders, comes from ideology and recent history under the Chinese Communist Party. When we go back before the communist takeover, China had structured a different and more open set of relationships with Muslim populations in Central Asia and along the Silk Road.Party apparatchiks will say differently. But China was not a dominant hegemon over Eurasia for much of its history. Its imperial court didn't hand down edicts to a ragged and impoverished 'Muslim world.' The silk roads were replete with cosmopolitan and prosperous empires, many of them Muslim, and China traded with them, and made enemies with others.Eurasia would have looked more like Europe, with scattered identities and languages and people, that traded and fought. Claiming that China has an ancient, imperial lineage over Central Asia would be like arguing ancient Rome, the Renaissance and Mussolini are all a line of continuity to Italy now, or the 19th century German Romantics inspired the rise of the Nazis.Mulan, the legendary figure, would have probably been Turkic, not Han Chinese, with a heritage closer to the Uyghurs and Kazakhs of today. Zheng He, the famed Chinese seafaring explorer, was Muslim, built mosques, and was key to connecting China with Muslim nations. The Qing dynasty, in the 19th century, wasn't all that interested in Xinjiang, finding control too costly.  The fact is that what we envision today as 'China' is really just a collection of disparate peoples, including Muslims, who happen to be blanketed under the aggressive, colonizing force of the CCP.In recent years, the Uyghur human rights issue has become wrapped up with broader strategic tensions between China and the United States, which makes it even less likely that the Chinese government will take U.S. concerns on board. What, if anything, can concerned foreign governments and individuals do to address the situation in Xinjiang?Because of sanctions, Chinese officials are terrified of the possibility that their assets in the U.S. and in the European Union could be exposed. But corporate transparency hasn't been a strong point in the U.S. system, and in the Caribbean where tax havens are typically under British control. We're more than happy to host the dirty money of foreign kleptocrats as long as we can take a cut.Many abuses come down to forced labor in global supply chains. Reforming the global offshoring system would be a strong way of pulling out the rug from underneath the CCP's human rights abusers.The U.S. and U.K., in particular, need stronger laws that require real-name registration on corporations that would open the door to exposing and freezing the holdings of CCP kleptocrats. The sanctions so far haven't been enough. By going after individual companies and people, they attack a symptom, not the problem. The CCP's human rights abusers get away with a lot, stashing their dirty money in the West, because Western law enforcement authorities are hamstrung from seeing who owns what in a transparent way.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;['Sebastian Strangio'];https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2021-08-24-1.jpg;False;;15.269742;1b9fd642640b6255f0ce52fd9aa1a22a;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

Concerned that advances in Chinese semiconductor technology benefit the People's Liberation Army, and seeking to maintain America's technological edge over the People's Republic of China, Washington has gone on the offensive.Chinese telecom giant ZTE was among the first to be hit with crippling sanctions in early 2018, after violating U.S. embargoes on Iran and North Korea. The move prevented ZTE from acquiring critical components from American semiconductor manufacturer Qualcomm. A year later, the Trump administration slapped export controls on Huawei, banning the sale of U.S.-made chips without prior license approval. In September 2020, the United States expanded its 'Entity List,' imposing restrictions on China's largest state-funded chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing Industrial Corp (SMIC). Washington believes these companies are aiding the Chinese Communist Party in conducting espionage and supporting China's civil-military integration efforts.U.S. pressure has forced Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co to turn its back on its biggest customer, halting sales to Huawei. Japanese chipmakers have suffered a similar fate and have found themselves scrambling to find new clients. Meanwhile, in Europe, the United States has effectively blocked Dutch company ASML from selling its most advanced lithography machine to SMIC. As shockwaves ripple through the semiconductor industry, Israel has seemingly emerged unscathed. In fact, 'Silicon Wadi' has found itself among the few benefactors of the fallout from the Sino-American tech-rivalry, for now.NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 2018 saw Israel's semiconductor exports to China rise by 80 percent. Much of this growth has been attributed to Intel's increasing sales to China from its recently upgraded Israeli plant, which some have argued served as a way around U.S. trade tariffs. But Gu Wenjun, chief analyst at Shanghai-based semiconductor consultancy ICWise, suggests that in the face of U.S. export restrictions, Beijing has been looking to Israel to acquire these advanced technologies. Gu told the press that 'because of the trade war, China and Israel's cooperation is closer than it has been before.'Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.China has indeed emerged as Israel's second-largest trading partner country, and semiconductors have become an important component of their economic relationship. According to Israel's Export Institute, the start-up nation sold $2.6 billion worth of semiconductors to China by the close of 2018, accounting for 56 percent of Israel's exports to the eastern giant. That same year, Chinese purchases of inspection equipment for semiconductor manufacturing from Israel climbed 64 percent, reaching $450 million. Eli Assoolin, CEO and co-founder of Israel start-up Newsight Imaging, told the media his company has 'sold hundreds of thousands of chips to Chinese companies, and the future looks very promising.'Chinese interest in Israel's semiconductor industry is driven by Xi Jinping's conviction that semiconductors are 'essential in China's plan to dominate the world's core technologies.' However, China's domestic semiconductor production lags far behind other countries in terms of design and manufacture of advanced microchips, which are technologically sophisticated and very difficult to produce. With local chipmakers only satisfying 16 percent of China's domestic semiconductor demand, China has become the world's largest buyer of chips – spending roughly $300 billion annually since 2018.China seeks to address this vulnerability by becoming more self-sufficient regarding chip design and technology production. As it happens, the strength of the Israeli semiconductor industry lies in the very things China wishes to acquire: superior design, cutting edge R&D, and the ability to integrate chips that interact smoothly between technologies. Many of the world's most advanced chips in the semiconductor industry were and are being developed in Israel. These include the Pentium MMX, Centrino, and Sandy Bridge from Intel, Sandisk latest flash technologies, Texas Instruments' Bluetooth chip, and Motorola chips for cellular phones.AdvertisementChinese multinationals have noted these achievements and have set out to acquire their share of Israeli know-how. Huawei has been running an R&D center in Israel since 2016, when it bought Toga Networks. Xiaomi followed suit, establishing a presence in the Israeli market around the same time it started manufacturing its own semiconductors in 2017. Chinese funds have since joined in on the action, with Neng Yang spending $35 million in 2019 to acquire Advanced Dicing Technologies (ADT); an Israeli company that develops specialized machinery for cutting silicon-based chips and microelectronic components. Chinese entities, including Baidu, Pingan, Qihoo, Shengjing 360, and Yongjin Group, have all invested in Israeli venture capital firms that fund Israeli semiconductor companies.China's growing presence in Israel has not gone unnoticed. Since labeling China a 'strategic competitor' in its 2017 National Security Strategy, the United States has been increasingly pressuring Jerusalem to curb its ties with Beijing, especially regarding critical infrastructure and advanced technologies. Israel established a mechanism to vet foreign investment into potentially sensitive industries in 2019. Still, this has not allayed U.S. concerns. In May 2020, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Israeli media that America does not 'want the Chinese Communist Party to have access to Israeli infrastructure, Israeli communication systems, all of the things that put Israeli citizens at risk.' He warned that engaging with China in sensitive areas could threaten intelligence sharing with the United States.Semiconductors are particularly sensitive in this context due to their dual-use nature. At the same time, not all chips are created equal. Military technologies require custom chips, different from those of consumer electronics and more difficult to produce. This is why not all Chinese semiconductor companies have been placed on the U.S. Entity List and why chipmakers like Intel have been granted licenses to continue selling certain chips to those that are. This disparity suggests that Israel has some room to maneuver provided it maintains well thought out controls to prevent dual-use transfers to China. Still, as relations between the two great powers become increasingly adversarial, even with these controls in place, Israel risks finding its U.S. ally less forgiving of its delicate balancing act.Dale Aluf is a political psychologist and the director of research and strategy at SIGNAL, Sino Israel Global Network & Academic Leadership, a member of China's Silk Road Think Tank Association SRTA.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;Shannon;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat-2020-11-13-10.jpg;False;;15.115935;f1c662bb357f65714ba773c9b41069f6;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 1}

It was first raised by Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro in the early 2000s, and became the guiding ideology of Japan's Asian diplomatic and economic policy during Hatoyama Yukio's administration, at a time when Japan was the largest economy in Asia. In a speech delivered to the Shangri-la Dialogue in May 2009, Australia's Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, too, advanced a proposal for an Asia Pacific Community aimed at building integrated regional institutions to counter China's rise; it did not significantly affect Asia-Pacific regionalism.Most discourse about China's regional influence – and thus Xi's concept of an Asia-Pacific Community – is preoccupied with the hard question of how to tame China's rise, as the question itself offers an academically puzzling and politically intriguing case. This essay aims to decode Xi's concept, explain how it is different from those proposed before, and draw implications for the Asian community.NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
A Power Balance Shift in AsiaEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.As Henry Kissinger has noted, great power competition is full of uncertainty and unpredictability and subject to potentially significant shifts in the balance of power. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has been the only superpower in the world, and the U.S.-led world order has been grounded in core U.S. values of liberty and democracy, which are shared by many Asian countries. The U.S.-led world order has been possible because of its economic and military power, and because of its role as a provider of global public goods, including defending its allies in war. AdvertisementWith China's rise as the world's second-largest economy, what Xi wants is to promote an alternative order in which sovereign nations' unique values should be respected. Xi has emphasized the importance of all humankind's equal rights to develop and grow in prosperity, whatever their ideology or political values. China has been actively increasing its contribution to global public goods by, for example, providing free COVID-19 vaccines to poor countries, and by investing in infrastructure along the Digital Silk Road.  In the dynamic power balance between the United States and China, competition between the two manifests at three layers: on the surface, it is a trade war; in the middle, it is a competition for technological leadership; and at its core, it is the competition for a world order. Unlike other great powers in history that challenged incumbents, China's rapid rise, both economically and technologically, has benefited greatly from the economic interdependence of the two countries. While a new world order is not on the horizon, the U.S.-led attempt at decoupling China from the global supply chains, especially the supply chains of critical technologies and strategic minerals, is significantly influencing the geopolitical landscape, especially in Asia, including Australia. In Asia, the shift of power balance has particularly significant geopolitical consequences. Japan's GDP was nine times China's in 1991 but had declined to about one-fifth of China's by 2021. China today accounts for more than half of Asia's economy and is the largest trading partner for most countries in Asia. With such a shift of economic power, the U.S.-supported Asian model centered around Japan is broken, and a new order of governance in trade, finance, and digital sphere that matches the rebalancing of power in Asia is urgently needed. The great power competition has caused many Asian countries to feel they have been caught in the middle. Lee Hsien Loong, the prime minister of Singapore, summed up this conundrum, saying, 'It will not be possible for Singapore to choose between the United States and China, given the extensive ties the Republic has with both superpowers.' That sentiment is shared by countries such as South Korea and Japan, the leaders of which both met with Xi during the recent summits. In Xi's vision of an Asia-Pacific Community with a shared future, China is the 'hub,' connecting with each individual nation in a hub-and-spokes model of a distributed supply chain network. Enjoying this article?

Amid the trade tensions between the United States and China, some of China's manufacturing facilities were relocated to its Asian neighbors, especially ASEAN countries. Contrary to a commonly-held view that these relocations have 'hollowed out' China's manufacturing power, rather, assembly and final production in those countries have become an extension of China's mega supply chain, relying on the supply of intermediate goods from China and the export of the final goods from those countries, to avoid increased tariffs on goods exported directly from China. The fact that China and ASEAN are now each other's largest trading partner is a manifestation of this change. According to China's customs data, in the first 10 months of 2022, the volume of trade between China and ASEAN increased 13.8 percent, reaching $798.4 billion. Intermediate goods account for over 60 percent of this trade, suggesting the two parties are highly interdependent and embedded in each other's production networks. China's mega supply chain is built upon its industrialization in many backbone heavy industries, such as machine tool building, steel and chemical production, which will take its Asian neighbors a long time to catch up with.If Xi's vision can be realized, even if the United States were able to pursue a de-Sinicized strategy in supply chains, an interdependent Asia-Pacific Community with China as a 'hub' might help Xi secure China's position in the world or, at least, deter the U.S.-led effort to decouple. AdvertisementImplications for the Asian CommunityThere are several reasons that, for the foreseeable future, it will not be feasible for Xi to realize his vision of building an Asia-Pacific Community, at least at the governance level. First, most of China's Asian neighbors have accepted the U.S.-led world order of freedom and democracy. A rising China with an authoritarian regime is perceived as a security challenge to those countries. Second, for a country to take a global/regional leadership role, it needs to have four dimensions in its structural power: (1) the capacity for the provision of security for itself and for other countries; (2) dominance in the production of goods and services; (3) being a key part of the finance and payment system in global trade; (4) significant contributions to global knowledge. While China is a dominant power in the production of goods, it misses all the other elements. Third, despite technological advancement over the past three decades, China still faces some critical technology bottlenecks, and it needs collaboration in science and technology with the West. Can Xi achieve his goal? Besides being a pragmatist, he is also a realist. According to Sun Tzu's 'Art of War,' when you can't beat an army of allied adversaries, you conquer them one by one. This is perhaps precisely what Xi was busy doing at one-on-one meetings with his Asian counterparts during last month's summits. As a first step, Xi needs to make sure that China's market will be open to its Asian partners, and every nation will benefit from this intra-Asia production network. Implications for AustraliaAustralia, as a resource provider in the China-centered production network, has benefited greatly in the past 20 years. Fifty years ago, the then-opposition leader Gough Whitlam led a delegation to China, which, subsequent to his party's election to government, secured Australia's diplomatic relationship with the PRC, even before the United States did. Whitlam managed to not just show Australia's loyalty to its strategic ally – the U.S. – but achieve Australia's own goal as a middle-power nation in the South Pacific. Thus, Whitlam has been remembered not just for his courageous action of reaching out to break the power balance during the Cold War, but also his move to reposition the country in alignment with Asia by leading to the ending of the country's 'White Australia' policy.The geopolitical landscape Australia is facing today is vastly different from Whitlam's time. Fifty years ago, China was a political lever on a grand chessboard between the United States and the Soviet Union, and, for Australia, siding with China was risky but not damaging to its alliance with Washington. Today, China's rise is challenging the dominance of the U.S. in trade, technology, and world order, and siding with China carries serious risks and possibly heavy consequences for Australia. However, the reality that Australia needs to face is, in the case of bifurcation in supply chains, Australia's endowment will make it less attractive if it is part of the 'friend-shoring' solution that the U.S. is aiming to build to exclude China. Australia will find it hard to replace China as a downstream partner and will face more competition in resources and agricultural products in the new supply chain. One might wonder what Whitlam's decision would be were he alive today.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2022-12-08-203610.jpg;False;;14.49905;24ac3c46405b7fe8ebbe6a50717dd8c1;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 2}
101;The Philippine-US Alliance Has a Major Blind Spot: Cybersecurity;;2022-08-04 12:15:00;timezone unknown;https://thediplomat.com/2022/08/the-philippine-us-alliance-has-a-major-blind-spot-cybersecurity/;thediplomat.com;Other U.S. alliances have undertaken significant measures to enhance collective defense in cyberspace. It's time for the Philippine-U.S. alliance to catch up.;"AdvertisementFrom imperial Japan to Communist insurgents and Islamic terrorists, the Philippine-U.S. defense relationship has effectively evolved over its 70-year lifespan to meet the changing regional and global threat environment. However, over the past 20 years, this adaptation has faltered. During this period, cyber operations have become an increasingly prominent tool of international conflict. Whereas other security partnerships like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Japan-U.S. alliance have undertaken significant measures to enhance collective defense in cyberspace, cyber cooperation has lagged within the Philippines-U.S. alliance.This is not merely a question of keeping pace with its collective security peers, as the inability to effectively counter cyber threats has resulted in new vulnerabilities that can undermine the alliance and hamstring its operations. A functional alliance should be capable of not only preempting large-scale disruptive attacks, but also rebuffing sustained cyber campaigns that degrade institutional trust and shape strategic outcomes.When U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken travels to the Philippines on August 6, he will have an opportunity to remedy this lapse and formally extend the Philippine-U.S. alliance into the digital domain.Cyber Conflict in World AffairsNGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
Article IV of the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) commits the United States and the Philippines to aid one another in the event of an 'armed attack' on either party. When the treaty was signed, amid the Korean War and less than a decade after World War II, the definition of an 'armed attack' was obvious and seemingly unambiguous. Nevertheless, in recent decades, world affairs have seen the proliferation of gray zone operations like hybrid warfare and maritime militias that allow countries to reshape security conditions and advance their interests through actions below the threshold of armed attack.Enjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.This is particularly pronounced with the use of cyber means in the pursuit of strategic interests.Cyber operations have been employed by governments to sabotage critical infrastructure, degrade military capabilities, damage economies, and artificially sow dissent, all whilst eschewing traditional notions of an 'armed attack.' More than 'cyber Pearl Harbors,' cyber operations have been employed like termites. Sustained cyberattacks with individually minimal impacts have significant cumulative effects that can reshape security conditions and yield significant strategic advantages. Recognition of the dangers posed by cyber operations has seen cybersecurity's inclusion as a national security issue and the proliferation of cyber military capabilities.However, the growth of cyber conflict poses an acute challenge to international alliances. While existing defense treaties commit parties to respond to an armed attack, what does this mean for cybersecurity, where the attacker's identity may be uncertain and harm can be inflicted without producing human casualties? Moreover, how are these institutions expected to respond when the actions do not necessarily violate established international norms and laws?AdvertisementThis dilemma became apparent in 2007, when Estonia experienced a massive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that crippled the country. The attack is believed to have been orchestrated by Russia, and Estonia sought to trigger NATO's collective response commitments under Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty. NATO declined. Individual members and NATO itself were quick to dispatch assistance to Estonia, but Article V was not invoked because of the ambiguity over whether a cyberattack with no loss of life constituted an 'armed attack.'The inadequacies of this response and the continued growth of cyber conflict necessitate a significant reexamination of how alliances respond to offensive cyber operations. Notably, NATO as well as the U.S. alliances with Japan and South Korea have taken significant steps to extend alliance capabilities and commitments into cyberspace, including indications that a cyberattack can constitute an 'armed attack.' Unfortunately, the Philippine-U.S. alliance has not kept pace with this development, and cybersecurity remains a blind spot within the alliance.Cybersecurity in the Philippine-U.S. AllianceCyber cooperation has not been wholly absent from the Philippine-U.S. alliance. Following a series of retaliatory cyberattacks by patriotic hackers in China and the Philippines during the 2012 Scarborough Shoal standoff, both the United States and Philippines vowed to work together on cybersecurity. Moreover, from some of the earliest days of the internet, preexisting points of bilateral cooperation have provided mechanisms for cyber cooperation and incident response. This was particularly prominent in 2016 when the Philippines was struck by a series of significant cyberattacks, and U.S. agencies like the Department of Justice provided assistance. These episodes, and the subsequent inclusion of a cybersecurity event as part of the 2017 Balikatan Exercises, seemingly heralded substantive growth of cyber cooperation within the alliance. Yet, over subsequent years cyber cooperation has stalled.The elections of Rodrigo Duterte and Donald Trump in 2016 posed challenges to the alliance that were uniquely detrimental to digital affairs. Along with direct attacks on the alliance, Duterte's rapprochement toward China included significant cooperation in information and communication technology (ICT) development as part of China's digital silk road. The inclusion of Chinese ICT in Philippine critical infrastructure increased U.S. concerns about Chinese espionage activities in the Philippines and brought Manila into direct conflict with the Trump administration and its global campaign against Chinese ICT companies like Huawei.Beyond this elite discord, underlying divergence also became apparent within the alliance in how each government pursued national cybersecurity. While both governments made cybersecurity a national priority after 2016, the United States focused on foreign governments as the primary threat. Philippine national security and cyber policies do note the threat posed by foreign governments but emphasized cybercrime and non-state actors. This divergent threat perception not only led to differing cyber strategies but also different institutional preferences that may have unintentionally sidelined preexisting points of cooperation. As a result, while cybersecurity remains a topic of discussion within the bilateral dialogue, but joint statements and short-term programs have failed fail to advance the alliance's ability to counter cyber threats.The stagnating of bilateral cooperation in cybersecurity constitutes a vulnerability within the alliance. The Philippines ranks among the most cyber insecure countries globally, with its critical infrastructure identified as being especially vulnerable to a foreign cyberattack. Within alliance operations, a partner's vulnerabilities are your own vulnerabilities, and successful cyberattacks on the Philippines could hamper the United States' ability to use locations in the Philippines to respond to regional crises. So significant is this concern that the U.S. has been encouraged to consider standalone power facilities to support critical locations in the archipelago.Enjoying this article?

The prominent use of disinformation campaigns during this year's national elections points to the Philippine population's susceptibility to such operations. This is significant as China in particular has previously attempted to use disinformation campaigns to target support for the Philippine-U.S. alliance.Consequently, while Blinken will not lack for topics of conversation when he meets with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. this week, digital affairs must be on the agenda. There are key steps that can be taken to substantively advance cybersecurity within the Philippine-U.S. alliance.At a recent conference, Ely Ratner, the assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs, stated that Washington was working with Manila 'to develop new bilateral defense guidelines that will clarify our respective roles, missions, and capabilities within the framework of our alliance.' It is essential that these guidelines formally recognize cyber operations as a type of 'armed attack' that leads to invocation of the Mutual Defense Treaty. Such a declaration would extend the Philippine-U.S. alliance into cyberspace and bring the partnership in line with other U.S. alliances. Furthermore, while it is not advisable to detail the specific conditions that could trigger Article IV, including cyber operations under the MDT's security umbrella closes a gap within the alliance that could otherwise be exploited by adversaries.AdvertisementHowever, extending alliance commitments to cybersecurity is irrelevant if not paired with corresponding capabilities, investments, and institutional development. The lifeblood of the Philippine-U.S. alliance is its schedule of regularized defense diplomacy activities and the more than 300 defense exercises held annually. Cybersecurity must be integrated into these activities and regularized to promote sustained growth in bilateral cyber cooperation. Including cyber events as part of the bilateral activities illustrates this possibility, and existing mechanisms like the State Partnership Program offer established means to expand bilateral cyber engagement. Likewise, as the Philippines and the United States develop new institutions and agencies to enhance national cybersecurity, these new entities must also be included in cooperative undertakings. Activities like U.S. Cyber Command's 'Hunt Forward' missions offer an immediate means to both improve bilateral cybersecurity and cultivate links between U.S. and Philippine cyber forces that bolster operational effectiveness within the alliance.Finally, it is essential to recognize that cybersecurity is a whole-of-nation problem that cannot be resolved independently of economic development, trade, and educational issues. For example, the Philippines' desire for economic development and the need to keep pace in a digitized world led to its embrace of Chinese ICT. Just as cybersecurity should not be ignored for economic expedience, partners should not be expected to sacrifice their economic well-being without aid or assistance. Whereas developments like supply chain diversification present a chance to address these dilemmas in mutually beneficial ways, but these will require significant investments and sustained political support.Blinken is unlikely to remedy such problems during one short visit, but is time for the alliance to realize that cybersecurity is a liability that neither government can continue to overlook.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2022-08-03-192218.jpg;False;;13.946614;ffa05232c7b6c0d9e680ac012857cb1a;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 2}

In a new report, titled 'Returning to the Shadows: China, Pakistan, and the Fate of CPEC,' Andrew Small catalogues the grand promises and countless pitfalls of CPEC. In an interview with The Diplomat, Small, a senior transatlantic fellow with the German Marshall Fund's Asia Program, explains the significance of CPEC to the China-Pakistan relationship, the contours of its highs and lows, and what the fate of the grand scheme means for China's broader Belt and Road Initiative.What's the significance of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to the China and Pakistan bilateral relationship? CPEC was supposed to act as a vehicle to upgrade the China-Pakistan partnership. Some Chinese analysts used to describe the relationship as a 'stool with two legs': While security and political ties have been strong for decades, economic ties had always been extremely weak. Even this characterization somewhat overstates the breadth of the relationship — it was almost entirely confined to military and intelligence matters, and managed by a very small cast of individuals on the two sides. China was never a factor in day-to-day economic or political life in Pakistan, and its strong approval ratings in opinion polls reflected its unimpeachable reputation as the 'all-weather friend' rather than any deeper affinity among the Pakistani public. That narrowness of relations also made it difficult for China to embrace Pakistan too openly — despite being arguably Beijing's closest partner, virtually anything the two sides did together was always viewed through a security prism, and China had to tread carefully to avoid eliciting alarmed reactions in New Delhi or further afield. CPEC was a way of changing that narrative. China could make a big public push to enhance the relationship while selling it as an economic and development matter. There was also a gamble involved: CPEC was dubbed the 'flagship' of the BRI, which tied its fate closely to the reputation of the entire initiative, and even to Xi Jinping himself. This was a risk that Beijing was willing to take. China wanted its relationship with Pakistan to be a 'model to follow': Close, trusted military ties that nonetheless fell short of the commitments of a formal alliance, underpinned by a comprehensive Chinese immersion in the country's economic life. If CPEC succeeded, other countries would look to replicate it.  NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter For Pakistan, the logic was even more compelling. CPEC was an opportunity to draw China into a deeper level of political, security, commercial, and financial commitment to the country, in a highly visible way, at a juncture where U.S. support was being tapered back on all fronts, and international investors were very wary of the security situation. For both sides, the optics are therefore almost as important as the substance. China and Pakistan have a strong incentive to put a good face on CPEC whatever is actually happening in practice.Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.The Khan administration's interest in modifying CPEC made headlines back in 2018. Since then, as you note in the report, CPEC first slowed then gradually sped up again. But in the interim, did the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government have any success in pushing for its desired changes?CPEC was already slowing down even before the PTI took power — by late 2017 Pakistan's economic situation was weakening and political uncertainties were growing as Nawaz Sharif and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)'s struggles with the army intensified. Imran Khan was known to be skeptical about CPEC — seeing it as too closely tied to the PML-N's agenda, a poor fit for his own priorities, and almost certainly corrupt too. Prominent figures in the PTI, such as the commerce minister and leading industrialist, Abdul Razak Dawood, were also public critics of CPEC, representing sections of the Pakistani business community that saw the benefits as too tilted to Chinese firms, and had themselves missed out on the explosion of CPEC contracts.  Beijing was ready to be accommodating to the new government's priorities. Its position had always been that the PTI just didn't understand that they could be beneficiaries too if they spelled out clearly enough what they wanted. In practice though, the model that Imran Khan was proposing was precisely the kind of economic relationship that China had always sought to avoid with Pakistan: In his first trip to Beijing after taking office, he asked for a bailout to address the country's weak financial position, and support for socio-economic projects, in other words, aid. AdvertisementInitially, China tried to figure out some way to rebalance CPEC around the PTI's priorities. As one Chinese official put it to me in the early months after the elections: 'We can do peanut projects instead of mega projects, if that's what they want.' They looked at making Pakistan a test country for China's new aid agency, as well as some agriculture and green energy projects, and they talked about renegotiating the terms of existing investments. But Beijing quickly grew fed up with the new government — particularly after the open criticism that CPEC received early in its tenure — and decided that they needed to go straight to the army instead, which they increasingly believed was running the show anyway. The result of that has been a slowed down and slimmed down CPEC but not necessarily a CPEC that bears the imprimatur of the PTI the way that its conception reflected the PML-N's infrastructure and energy-centered agenda.    What factors contributed to the more recent downgrading of ambitions for CPEC by both Pakistan and China? Did one drive the dampening of enthusiasm more than the other? It's important to mention that CPEC is seeing a mini-resurgence at the moment. What should be the single largest project under CPEC, the ML-1 railway line upgrade from Karachi to Peshawar, is supposed to be moving ahead, and there are a couple of new hydro-electric dams. Officials on both sides will publicly dispute that there has been any downgrading of ambitions. But the really transformative plan that was originally envisaged — a multi-stage transformative agenda for the Pakistani economy — is not really there anymore, and the overall scale is no longer on a par with the kinds of figures that were being talked about a few years back. This reflects a confluence of factors. Pakistan's economy has struggled in recent years, which has affected the government's financing capacity. The BRI is no longer characterized by such an overriding focus on speed and scale as it was when CPEC launched. China found the political obstacles to be a real headache, and essentially decided to hold back until it was clear that they had partners on the Pakistani side that actually wanted to deliver on CPEC. But in Pakistan, too, there were questions from a number of corners about whether the full-scale version made sense — the debt levels, the implications for Pakistani businesses of an influx of Chinese firms in the special economic zones, the degree of dependence on China that was building, and many other factors besides. For its part, the army was not so comfortable about such a vast civilian-led economic agenda for the country either; it represented a potential rebalancing of power in Pakistan, and indeed China even sold it as that: A move toward a less military-centric view of national strength. Some of the frictions around these issues were not entirely helpful for the broader relationship either — so if anything there is a mutual sense that a slimmed-down version of CPEC may be preferable, as long as the public reputation is carefully managed.  With the PTI government less interested in CPEC than the previous Sharif administration, the military has taken over more control. What are the implications of the renewed emphasis on China-Rawalpindi relations for Pakistan's always tenuous civil-military balance?The army was unhappy about the level of control it exercised over CPEC, and the role the PML-N occupied in running it. That has now been 'fixed.' Even if China has certain preferences and views about how Pakistan should think about its national strategy, Beijing is ultimately indifferent about who is in charge in Pakistan as long as they deliver on Chinese objectives. I think there is a recognition on the Chinese side that CPEC ended up on the wrong side of the civil-military struggle and there will be even greater care to ensure that doesn't happen again. Enjoying this article?

There was a genuine case to be made for the latter in CPEC's first couple of years, but that's clearly no longer true — instead CPEC is now likely to help the army entrench its role in an even wider range of economic decision-making and execution than its usual prerogatives. To be fair to China, this is not what they intended. They were not happy with how the Pakistani army treated Nawaz Sharif. But they have accommodated themselves to what happened and would rather work through a GHQ-centered set of structures if it means that some credible version of CPEC happens. I expect, as a result, that it will be difficult to get back to a civilian-led model for CPEC again. Given that it represents such an important part of Pakistan's economic life, even on its more modest scale, that has some obvious long-term implications.  At a recent All Parties Conference, Pakistan's opposition issued a series of demands, mostly relating to allegations of election rigging and military interference in Pakistan's government. But one of their demands was that CPEC be 'expedited,' with the opposition accusing the PTI of endangering the initiative. In most countries (Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and the Maldives, for example), we've seen the opposite: pro-democracy forces aligned against Chinese investments and development projects, citing increased corruption risks and lack of transparency. Can you explain the role of CPEC in Pakistan's domestic politics?The routine with CPEC in Pakistani domestic politics is that everyone expresses their profound support for it in principle and then the opposition criticizes the form that it is taking in practice with the government in power, and the way it is being executed. This reflects China's sanctified status in Pakistan. It is still the 'all-weather friend,' and its importance as a security partner and financial backer has only grown.AdvertisementBeijing also has a radioactive reaction to any hint of public criticism. As we saw early in the PTI's term in office, Chinese officials would routinely call on the army to get any critical ministers to shut up. So although there are many of the same concerns about CPEC in Pakistan as elsewhere — corruption, debt, transparency issues, advantageous terms for Chinese companies and so on — these tend to be expressed in private, and generally not to the Chinese. But we also have a situation at the moment where some of CPEC's biggest critics are in government. For the PML-N and the PPP, which also claimed credit for aspects of CPEC — such as China's decision to take Gwadar on again — the line has been that the PTI is squandering the economic opportunity that it represents. BRI politics also reflect electoral cycles. The skeptical opposition takes power and figures out its own accommodation with China, while the former governing parties then either take a more critical position itself or attack their successors for failing to handle relations with Beijing effectively. Of course, China doesn't like this and wants to stay above the fray, but the scale of the BRI in some of these countries is on too large a scale for that to be possible. In Pakistan, though, Beijing still has the means to shut some of these voices down.What can the fate of CPEC tell us about China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) more broadly?CPEC has been a chastening experience for China in the context of the BRI. Given its special relationship with Pakistan, this was supposed to be a politically easier experience than elsewhere, for all the security and economic challenges they knew they would face. It has been a demonstration that the grand-scale version of its plans may just be too difficult to execute — too exposing and contentious in countries where it simply doesn't have the depth of relationships or expertise to pull it off, however close its top-level ties are. China cannot expect to replicate its own model outside its borders in very different political, cultural and economic contexts.  One response could have been to come up with a new model — a BRI 2.0 and a CPEC 2.0 — that put things on a more sustainable footing, financially, politically, and environmentally, built consensus, and tailored plans even more closely to countries' needs. The alternative is just to slow things down, scale things down, but basically plow ahead with the same approach as before, with a tighter focus on some of China's own higher priorities, such as the Digital Silk Road projects or, in Pakistan, getting Gwadar wrapped up. I think that's generally what we're seeing: more of the same, just not quite as much, and with some modest re-prioritization. The big unknown now, though, is debt. Pakistan is among the many countries that are having to renegotiate terms on their overall finances and on specific projects, given the pandemic-induced economic crisis. For now that has actually opened the spigots again as the two sides look to stimulate the Pakistani economy with new investments. But there is still a reckoning to come. This is one area where Pakistan is in a sui generis position — given its importance to China, Beijing is willing to do more to shore up the country's economy than in most other cases. However, we may yet see even more constraints on the Pakistani government's finances again, as was the case with the last IMF program, which played its own role in slowing CPEC down. For all that China needs to swing in to secure the BRI's reputation and Pakistan's strategic position, and for all that the politics of CPEC have been squared between the army and the Chinese government, there is still the prospect that after this mini-resurgence, CPEC will collide with hard economic realities again, as everywhere else along the BRI.Finally, we are starting to see, in Pakistan, less caution about certain perceptions of the BRI — Beijing wants to maintain a narrative of success but they seem to care less now about sensitivities relating to political issues, such as projects in Kashmir where they once trod carefully around India's reaction, or the fact that CPEC is, given the army's heightened role, increasingly securitized. As we have seen in other elements of Chinese foreign policy this year, it appears that we are moving to an approach that is more unabashed about the function the BRI is supposed to occupy in fulfilling China's wider strategic objectives.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;Catherine Putz;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat-china-pakistan.jpg;False;;13.314839;2351676a29516626e83b25b30af0d0bc;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 2}
103;What Explains Growing European Engagement in Central Asia?;;2022-11-21 18:25:00;full;https://thediplomat.com/2022/11/what-explains-growing-european-engagement-in-central-asia/;thediplomat.com;In recent years, the EU has shifted how it views Central Asia. That effort culminated recently with the first EU-Central Asia leaders summit.;"AdvertisementAt the end of October 2022, President of the European Council Charles Michel paid his first official visit to Astana and held a summit with the leaders of all five Central Asian states — Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The EU-Central Asia leaders' summit took place for the first time as Russia's influence in Central Asia has been showing early signs of dwindling amid its unprovoked war with Ukraine. Michel called the summit 'more than just a dialogue between two regions' and stressed that the two regions are 'coming closer together and becoming more and more connected.' While in the Kazakh capital, Michel also called for greater cooperation between the EU and Central Asia, adding he was looking ahead to the Samarkand EU Central Asian Connectivity Conference planned for November 18, which his colleague, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell, attended.What is the rationale for the EU's latest engagement with the five Central Asian countries and its call for boosting cross-border cooperation between Central Asia and the EU?First, the EU is driven by its geopolitical ambition to adjust its status as a secondary actor in the region that straddles a strategic geographic space at the heart of Eurasia, bordering Russia to the north, China to the east, and Afghanistan and Iran to the south. Until now, the region has been largely seen through the lens of a new 'great game' competition among three great powers — Russia, China, and the United States. The three have attempted to dominate the region in pursuit of their largely divergent interests by applying classic 'divide and rule' tactics. Russia, with firm persistence, has attempted to maintain a strong presence in the region by forming security and economic alliances – the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). China, in turn, loaned Central Asia billions to build major import-export and energy supply connectivity projects as part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) that complement its economic and geopolitical ambitions. Meanwhile, the U.S. sought to encourage neoliberal institutions in Central Asian states and develop them on the path toward democracy and market economy. In startling contrast to these powers, the EU did not have significant geopolitical interests in Central Asia and considered the states in the region as 'neighbors of its neighbors.' For that reason, the EU put Central Asia presumably into the fold of its wider European Neighborhood Policy. However, with the continuing Western 'polycrisis' and growing Chinese and Russian assertiveness in Central Asia, the EU has begun to reconsider its foreign policy direction, taking into account the differences of the states in the region. This led to the adoption of the New Strategy on Central Asia in 2019, which shifted EU foreign policy from a Brussels-centric normative power to principled pragmatism and resilience. NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
This is guided by a series of changes in the Global Strategy for the EU's Foreign and Security Policy (EUGS) toward identifying geopolitics as an essential if not definite factor of EU foreign policy in the 21stcentury.  Prior to her visit to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan on October 30, German Foreign Minister Annabella Baerbock stated that Germany does not want to see Central Asia 'being straitjacketed in Russia's front yard or being dependent on China.' This statement clearly demonstrated the geopolitical aspirations of both Germany and the EU to take part in a new 'great game' to prevent the unhindered growth of Russian and Chinese influence in the region. Enjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.Second, the EU aims to intensify cooperation with Central Asia in order to attain its geoeconomic ambitions to increase Euro-Asian connectivity — physical and non-physical infrastructure via which goods, people, ideas, and services can move freely. Although the EU has not introduced its own BRI in Central Asia, it has been deeply involved in the sphere of connectivity. In the 2007 Central Asia Strategy, the EU set a priority to establish energy and transport connections linking the two regions. However, Brussels has been passive in actualizing the Caspian-Black Sea pipeline and an 'e-silk highway,' lagging behind the Chinese BRI and Russian-led EAEU. In late 2018, the EU put forward its strategy on connecting Europe and Asia with concrete policy proposals and initiatives to improve energy, transport, digital, and people-to-people connectivity in Eurasia. The strategy states that non-engagement is not a choice for the EU while China is growing its influence in Central Asia.By endorsing the revised strategy on Central Asia, the EU acknowledged the strategic importance of Central Asia in its global efforts to strengthen sustainable, comprehensive, and rule-based connectivity within Eurasia. To that end, the EU intended to bolster relations with the Central Asia states through a bilateral approach based on broad-based and mutually beneficial Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreements (EPCA), which has been underscored over the regional approach considering the unique characteristics of each and every country in the region. The EU has implemented an EPCA with Kazakhstan, and also signed a Temporary Trade Agreement with Turkmenistan. In July 2022, the EU and Uzbekistan successfully completed three-year talks and signed a new EPCA in Brussels. Furthermore, the EU's revised strategy on Central Asia proclaims that Brussels is also committed to implementing EPCAs with the other interested states of Central Asia — Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.AdvertisementIn late 2021, European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen proclaimed that the EU would mobilize up to 300 billion euro of investments for the launch of a new connectivity initiative — Global Gateway for 2021-2027. This ambitious project can be elucidated as a response to China's BRI, which is now affiliated with 139 countries. It also gives signals that in the upcoming years, the EU will push forward networks with various states in different parts of the world and extend up to the Central Asian countries.Third, the EU aims to step up cooperation on security challenges in Central Asian states and Afghanistan. It should be noted that the EU's security interpretation is strikingly broad and entails a larger number of threats and a wider range of actors than traditional definitions. With the foreign policy shift to principled pragmatism/resilience, the EU developed a pragmatic approach to broader issues of global security underlining the impact of neighboring states and their close neighbors on the EU with respect to security, terrorism, migration, and economics. For that reason, the EU gives priority to domestic and border security in line with a pragmatic ad hoc emphasis on external powers close to Europe. In this context, it is to the strategic benefit of the EU to promote the resilience of states and societies in Central Asia. The EU is particularly interested in enhancing cooperation with Central Asian states against such common security issues as radicalization, violent extremism, terrorism, hybrid and cyber threats, and nuclear safety and security. The EU furthermore emphasizes the significance of confronting the socioeconomic roots of radicalization. During Michel's official visit to Astana at the end of October, the EU and Central Asian leaders remarked on the potential of cooperation in border management and security, the joint fight against terrorism, transnational organized crime and drug trafficking, migrant smuggling, and other new security threats in compliance with universal principles.The sudden withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan and the subsequent collapse of the Afghan Republic government worried both Central Asia and the EU; both were concerned about Afghanistan turning into a source of threats to regional and international peace and security. Acknowledging the crucial role of Central Asia in global efforts to promote inclusive peace, security and sustainable development in Afghanistan and emphasizing that these efforts should bring advantage to the region, the EU aims to encourage closer connectivity between Central Asia and South Asia via Afghanistan.Overall, the first official summit between the president of the European Council and Central Asia's leaders is a crucial development in the new 'great game.' The EU's engagement is driven by its geopolitical and geoeconomic interests to prevent the unhindered rise of Russian and Chinese influence, and by its domestic concerns to tackle security challenges in Central Asia and beyond. New EU ambitions will give an opportunity to the states in the region to intensify comprehensive partnerships with the EU, which can play a positive part in the region by offering an alternative to Moscow and Beijing and assisting the Central Asian states to diversify their economies, intensify regional connectivity, and develop their societies. In this context, the EU's ambition to change its secondary player status seems relatively feasible. However, the EU will have to compete with Russia and China, along with other rising regional powers in the region like Turkey, India, and Iran.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2022-11-21-183119.jpg;False;;12.600771;4b99e02a2becced752b4732cebc5d7e2;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 2}
104;2 Major Traps on China's Path to Global Leadership;;2022-09-01 06:45:00;timezone unknown;https://thediplomat.com/2022/09/2-major-traps-on-chinas-path-to-global-leadership/;thediplomat.com;There are at least two major obstacles that China will have to get over on its path to global leadership, one domestic and one outward-facing.;"AdvertisementChinese authorities are anything but humble when they set out their long-term vision: making their country a leading economic and technological power by 2049, the 100th anniversary of the creation of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese don't just want to be a superpower – they believe that they deserve to be one, that it's their destiny to lead the world.Chinese leaders are convinced that we're witnessing the end of the post-Cold War Pax Americana and the transition to a new world order, which will ultimately find China in the driver's seat. The vast majority of official pronouncements exude the utter conviction that the U.S. and the Western liberal order are in terminal decline, while there are very few lonely voices that question the precise degree and speed of that decline.China has indeed made spectacular and truly unprecedented progress over the past 40 years or so. But is it likely to achieve the ambitious objective set by the CCP? There are at least two major obstacles – or, rather, sets of obstacles – that China will have to get over on its path to global leadership. The first set of obstacles relates to China's political and economic governance ('the middle-income trap'), and the second to Beijing's capabilities to claim a leading role in the international arena ('the Kindleberger trap').The Middle-Income TrapNGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
Statistically, China already stands at the doorstep of the high-income club, with an average per capita income at $12,555 in 2021. Chinese authorities vehemently reject the middle-income trap theory, which posits that the growth potential in the majority of export-driven low-skill economies is exhausted before the countries in question attain the innovative capability they need to compete with developed countries in higher value-chain industries. Yet, the severe headwinds China's economy is increasingly facing show that this discussion is not irrelevant.Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.China's slowdown should not be attributed exclusively to the disastrous impact of the zero-COVID strategy as a temporary drag on the economy. The pandemic has merely exacerbated a host of structural deficiencies that were obvious even before the coronavirus outbreak in 2020. China is reeling under the deadweight of excessive debt, caused by massive misallocation of capital and obsession with costly infrastructure that is not always needed. The real estate bubble, with the liabilities of the Evergrande behemoth alone accounting for 3 percent of China's GDP, may be the most serious crisis China has faced in the past 40 years. In fact, unsustainable investment in housing and infrastructure has become the single biggest source of bad growth in China.Add to that a rapidly aging population, which will also sap China's future growth prospects due to a shrinking workforce, coupled with low levels of educational attainment. While China performs well on many measures of innovation, adding quality alongside quantity in this process will be crucial to the CCP's ambitions. As a result of all the above predicaments, China's total factor productivity (TFP) growth has been steadily declining since 2010, when the country bade farewell to double-digit growth rates. Clearly then, most of the fall in GDP growth rates merely mirrors the decline in TFP growth.Chinese authorities have been trying to tackle industrial overcapacity, local debt mountains and shadow banking, the property bubble, and to spur innovation across the board. Key policies of the Chinese government aim to help rebalance China's economy, wean it off its predominantly export-driven model, promote state-of-the-art technologies, tap into the huge domestic market, and make the country more self-sufficient. Yet, many of these efforts are falling flat. The shift from a nation of shippers to a nation of shoppers has turned out to be much more difficult than expected: Domestic consumption remains weak, while Chinese exports have hit record levels thanks to generous state support provided to manufacturing.AdvertisementClearly, noble intentions and lofty pronouncements by China's leaders do not ensure the turn to an entirely new innovation-based paradigm, which would help the country overcome the middle-income trap. While few watchers see a systemic risk in China at this stage, the country's economic 'miracle' seems to be well past its peak and the long-term outlook of its economy is turning dimmer with the passage of time. China is widely expected to overtake the U.S. in terms of its nominal GDP, but there is a universal consensus that this may take longer than was initially thought. In order for China to surpass the United States by 2035, its economy would have to grow at 4 percent a year; however, annual economic growth could well drop to 2-3 percent in the coming years. And there are persistent doubts lingering over the credibility of Chinese statistics, meaning that the much-trumpeted doubling of the country's GDP and per capita income between 2020 and 2035 should not be taken for granted.The Kindleberger TrapAnd, as if these internal challenges weren't enough, China will have to address the even more challenging 'Kindleberger trap' on the international arena. Charles Kindleberger, a prominent American economist, has argued that leading powers have the responsibility to provide global public goods, such as peace, security, stability, prosperity, a clean environment, and more. China clearly aims to position itself as a leader in 21st-century global governance, but how likely is it to acquire the capabilities to act as a responsible global power? Its prospects are mixed, at best.China has risen to the position of the second largest economy worldwide and can rightfully boast impressive achievements as a testimony to its rising engineering and scientific prowess. There's no doubt it's making advances in the ever-intensifying tech competition with the United States. It is closing on the U.S. in terms of R&D spending as share of its GDP, even though Chinese institutions are still more into applied rather than basic research, i.e. imitation at the expense of genuine innovation. Chinese universities are becoming markedly stronger in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).In the battle for artificial intelligence (AI) supremacy, China now publishes more papers on related topics than any other country, though U.S. and European papers are still cited more often. Research efforts are well underway in the fields of quantum computing and communications. China is clearly dominant across green technologies domains, such as the production of solar panels, and CATL is a world leader in the area of batteries for electric vehicles. China's large deposits of strategically important rare earths or access to related natural resources overseas also give it a comparative advantage over competitors.At the same time, there are areas where China is still lagging behind key competitors, the sector of semiconductors being a case in point. The state-owned Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) has gobbled subsidies worth tens of billions of dollars, but is still reliant on state-of-the art Western equipment.By the end of 2021, China's share in the global economy had exceeded 18 percent and is set to keep growing. However, recent IMF analysis shows that China's slowdown has become increasingly painful, with major consequences for the global economy. And, while the Chinese renminbi is one of the reserve currencies, it has not been able to challenge the financial hegemony of the U.S. dollar.Enjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.Another big challenge to China's prospects as a driving engine of global development is presented by the checkered track record of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), once hailed by Chinese leader Xi Jinping as the 'project of the century.' Many reports of late have uncovered a mountain of non-performing loans provided by Chinese policy banks to recipient countries and the BRI now risks metastasizing into a series of controversies and debt crises.Mounting problems do not obscure the fact that in many developing countries construction with Chinese finance has yielded some much-needed infrastructure. But a number of 'white elephants' and the debts piling up have dealt a serious blow to China's image as a competent and reliable partner of the Global South. The big question now is whether and to what extent Beijing will participate in multilateral debt relief efforts in BRI recipient countries. Ironically, a multilateral approach is counter-intuitive for Beijing because the BRI has been designed with a strictly bilateral and Sino-centric logic.It may be even more difficult for China to ensure global public goods in the areas of peace and security. China is a major contributor to U.N. peacekeeping operations, second in terms of financial inputs and ninth as to the number of troops. On the face of it, this may seem impressive, but it doesn't really match the country's size, economic heft, and ambitions. The Global Security Initiative (GSI) presented by Xi Jinping in April 2022, is a set of generic statements and little content. The GSI may find resonance in some developing countries, where frustration with elements of the U.S.-led order is manifest, but it is highly unlikely to be endorsed by Western allies. In fact, the GSI signals Xi's attempt to create a platform for China's own partnerships.AdvertisementBeijing's credibility is severely undermined by its fence-sitting on Russia's invasion of Ukraine and lip service to the notions of 'sovereignty' and 'territorial integrity,' as it has essentially endorsed Moscow's narrative about the war. In fact, instead of consistently upholding values, the new hymnbook of Chinese diplomats is marked by a flexible approach to inconvenient questions, 'based on the merits of the issue.' So far, China appears to shy away from undertaking global responsibilities on a par with its status and pronouncements.Nor is Beijing committed to the stability of the existing global architecture with its vision of a new world order, as laid out in the joint Sino-Russian manifesto released in February 2022. Xi and Putin have embarked on nothing short of an anti-Western illiberal crusade that brings Western nations closer together against Beijing and Moscow alike. While China is making inroads into the Global South, it is antagonizing the West as a broad constellation of allies and like-minded partners, whom Beijing tends to view as 'U.S. poodles.' The Quad formation or the trilateral AUKUS deal largely relate to China's rise over the past few decades and its assertive posture under Xi. The recent show of military force around Taiwan in the wake of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's controversial visit raises additional questions about China's commitment to the peaceful resolution of complex geopolitical disputes.China's potential leading role on a global scale is even more questionable in the area of public health. In the wake of the 2003 SARS epidemic and above all the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Beijing is clearly on the back foot. A raft of anywhere-but-here conspiracy theories have done more harm than good to China's image. The Health Silk Road, heavily promoted by the CCP government as part of its propaganda counteroffensive, has now sunk into near-oblivion, despite the sales of Chinese vaccines, masks, and other supplies to a number of countries. Nor does it help that the Chinese vaccines do not match the efficacy of Western mRNA vaccines. And future outbreaks in China cannot be precluded: New pathogens, such as the Langya virus, are already being reported.Just as worryingly, China is an unlikely global leader in the containment of the existential climate crisis. Despite its massive investment in green technologies, China is still the most polluting nation on the Earth in absolute figures, accounting for more than a quarter of world carbon emissions. Beijing's commitment to carbon neutrality by 2060 does not reflect the urgency of the matter, nor is this commitment confirmed by China's decision to suspend climate talks with the U.S. in the wake of Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.Given all the above developments, China's global image has deteriorated markedly over the past few years. This will not negate its ability to wield vast economic and military power in its own neighborhood or further abroad. But Beijing's reputation and overall soft power have bottomed out, despite a wide range of efforts to expand its public diplomacy. Ironically, China's charm offensives are undermined first and foremost by its increasingly pompous rhetoric, confrontational diplomacy (including its notorious 'wolf warrior' tenet), and the undisguised use of economic coercion applied to countries that are less than infatuated with Beijing leadership ambitions.A Mix of Ambition and AngstMany analysts put a significant weight on past performance when thinking about China's future trajectory. But the golden era of rapid Chinese economic growth is gone and the country's further progress is not guaranteed, as it will require profound structural reforms that may prove politically difficult. Under Xi Jinping, the role of the state in the economy has become ever tighter, and this will further hold back productivity growth.For all that, China's sheer size guarantees that the country will remain a key driver of global growth, though it is less clear to what extent. Despite signs of intensifying diversification, China will retain its pivotal role in global supply chains and strong – if not leading – position in a number of sectors. It will obviously be an economic giant and, despite its low productivity, will continue to wield enormous market power.China will most probably become the world's largest economy, but it is unlikely to enjoy a meaningful lead over the U.S. and will remain far less prosperous. With long-term average economic growth of 2-3 percent, China will lack the economic heft needed to compete with Western economies as a group; for example, in terms of its ability to devote resources to science and innovation, military spending, or financing overseas infrastructure projects.No doubt, Beijing will seek to increase its outreach and global sway through its strong presence in the U.N. or by means of institutions structured around China, such as BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and others. However, the gap between China's rhetoric about multilateralism and its preference for bilateral relations with the vast majority of countries won't vanish.Beijing will continue to act as an agenda-setter, mostly in the name of the Global South, even though a number of developing nations will increasingly ask themselves whether China is a partner or a predator. Beijing's foreign policy to prospective allies will probably remain a cocktail of pledges and pressure, if not veiled coercion. China's weak soft power and negative image in the West will inevitably constrain its international clout and global leadership.A visibly weakened United States, distracted by its own domestic challenges, is definitely losing ground, but China does not seem to be ready to replace it as a global leader. Notably, Beijing seems to be driven by an odd mix of ambition and angst, and this is where the middle-income trap meets the Kindleberger trap. While the ambition is clear, the angst derives from a creeping suspicion in Beijing that China's future may prove to be vastly different from the dominant narrative of its incessant rise. Precisely because things may not pan out as previously expected, the CCP is getting ahead of itself and is increasingly turning to a nationalistic rhetoric. This will render China considerably more dangerous and anything but a responsible global leader.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat-2020-09-28-13.jpg;False;;12.4284525;bf746e112abc4ca61893212f0d85999c;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 2}

The digital economy has changed the way people live and represents the future of the global economy. For developing countries, the digital economy is an opportunity to enliven the consumer market, create new growth points, empower industrial transformation and upgrading, give rise to new business models and promote high-quality development.
 
China and ASEAN are both highlands of digital economy development. China is a leader in the digital economy, at the forefront of digital infrastructure, smart cities and digital government resources, as well as several world-class digital enterprises.
 
In 2022, China's digital economy reached 50.2 trillion yuan (US$6.9 trillion), ranking second globally, and the country's online retail sales amounted to 13.79 trillion yuan, ranking first in the world.
 
ASEAN's digital economy has seen rapid developing in recent years, showing great potential, with the accelerated rollout of digital platforms and digital technologies in many countries, and booming development of industries such as e-commerce, transportation applications and online services. By the end of June 2022, half of the world's 10 fastest-growing countries in terms of online retail sales, including the top three, were ASEAN members. ASEAN is expected to be among the world's top five digital economies by 2025.
 
China and ASEAN are natural partners in digital economy development. The ASEAN market has already attracted some leading Chinese digital enterprises, including e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba, Tencent and Jingdong, mobile payment enterprises such as Ant Group, digital information enterprises such as Huawei and ZTE and some courier and logistics enterprises.
 
These Chinese enterprises have cooperated with partners in ASEAN countries to promote advanced technologies and mature business models within ASEAN, and they have assisted Southeast Asia in building digital economic ecosystems that promote the rapid rise of local digital enterprises such as Shopee, Lazada and Tokopedia, which has greatly driven the development of ASEAN's digital industry and the construction of its digital interconnectivity.
 
Because of geographic proximity, people-to-people affinity, integrated economies and highly complementary industries, China and ASEAN members are highly compatible in terms of digital economy development planning and industrial needs. The digital economy will be a new 'blue ocean' in China-ASEAN economic and trade cooperation, creating many opportunities.
 
At the ASEAN-China Special Summit to Commemorate the 30
th
 anniversary of ASEAN-China Dialogue Relations in 2022, China and ASEAN established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized that China would expand cooperation in the digital economy with ASEAN.
 
Since then, the two sides have been accelerating digital cooperation, gradually improving strategic alignment and speeding up the implementation of the Initiative on Building ASEAN-China Partnership on Digital Economy. More than half of ASEAN member states have signed bilateral e-commerce cooperation memorandums with China and established the ""Silk Road E-commerce"" cooperation mechanism.
 
New chapters on the digital economy that are included in the ongoing negotiations on the Version 3.0 China-ASEAN Free Trade Area, and an initiative on deepening e-commerce cooperation will be published at the upcoming China-ASEAN Leaders' Summit.
 
In addition, China and the Southeast Asian bloc have utilized platforms such as the China-ASEAN Expo and the China-ASEAN Information Port to vigorously promote cooperation on projects in the fields of digital government, digital enterprises, digital industries and new communications.
 
This year marks the 10
th
 anniversary of President Xi's proposal to build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future through the Belt and Road Initiative. China will use this as an opportunity to plan for cooperation in areas such as the digital economy with ASEAN and other countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative.
 
This year, Indonesia, as ASEAN's rotating chair, has adopted the theme ""ASEAN Matters: Epicentrum of Growth"" and chosen digital economy cooperation as one of the priority agendas. At this historic juncture linking past achievements with prospects, China and ASEAN should work together to embrace and promote the new era of the digital economy.
 
We need to further strengthen the synergy of digital development strategies, enhance digital connectivity and build an integrated China-ASEAN digital market. We need to promote an exchange of experience and capacity-building training and improve rulemaking by agreeing on high-level digital rules.
 
We should push for lower tariffs, more efficient customs clearance, more connected payment methods and faster logistics and transportation so that more ordinary people and enterprises can enjoy the benefits of digital economy development.
 
Next month, Jakarta will host the bloc's leaders' meetings on East Asia cooperation. We are ready to work with ASEAN countries at the meetings to promote fruitful results and push China-ASEAN digital economy cooperation to a new level.

106;Building on past success to open up new prospects for China-Indonesia friendship;The Jakarta Post;2023-04-26 00:15:00;timezone unknown;https://www.thejakartapost.com/opinion/2023/04/25/building-on-past-success-to-open-up-new-prospects-for-china-indonesia-friendship.html;thejakartapost.com;ASEAN and China have deepened cooperation in green development, climate change, environmental protection, energy transition and digital economy, and have worked together in implementing the Global…;"With its strong resilience amid global crisis, abundant resources, large population and rising international influence, Indonesia has made the world optimistic about its prospects. Facing a tumultuous world, Indonesia maintains vigilance, practices prudence and commits to regional peace, stability and prosperity without being dragged into a geopolitical competition.
 
China and Indonesia enjoy a long-standing friendship, and our relations took on a high-speed train last year. Last July, President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo visited China, as the first foreign head of state after the Beijing Winter Olympics. Last November, President Xi Jinping visited Indonesia, his first foreign visit after the 20th Congress of the ruling party of China. The two leaders reached an important consensus on building a China-Indonesia community with a shared future and reaffirmed the commitment to firmly support each other on issues of core interests concerning national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity, showing the strength of our bilateral ties.
 
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Indonesia. China will further follow the consensus reached by the two leaders, implement the Five-Year Action Plan, conduct high-level four-pillar cooperation covering politics, economy, people-to-people exchanges and maritime projects, and work more on such new flagship programs as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Corridor and green industrial parks.
 
This January, Indonesia approved the implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). China supports setting up an RCEP secretariat at an early date and upgrading it at a proper time. China has applied to join the CPTPP and Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA). We stand ready to conclude high-standard free trade agreements with more countries and strengthen digital connectivity.
 
Chinese modernization features peaceful development. President Xi proposed the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, which called for shared values of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, and urged the seeking of common development, collective security and mutual learning between civilizations.
 
As a major developing country, an emerging economy with the world's largest Muslim population, Indonesia is to realize the grand Indonesian Vision 2045. Hence, in this turbulent world, we support each other for win-win cooperation, a blessing for our two countries and the whole region.
 
Indonesia is this year's rotating president of ASEAN. President Jokowi pointed out that Indonesia would maintain ASEAN centrality and unity, regional peace and political stability, and emphasized that ASEAN should not be a proxy of any party and should prevent regional competition from becoming conflict.
 
He committed to promoting the economy by hosting the flagship Asia-Pacific Forum, exploring cooperation in the creative and digital economy, commercial investment and infrastructure, to make ASEAN a powerhouse of regional growth, which is highly acclaimed by the international community.
 
Over the past decade, under the guidance of President Xi and leaders of ASEAN members, China-ASEAN relations have gotten on a fast track. China was the first to establish a strategic partnership and start free trade agreement negotiations with ASEAN, to express its support for the centrality of ASEAN in regional cooperation and its willingness to sign the Treaty on the Southeast Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone.
 
Friends from ASEAN have told me that the China-ASEAN partnership is the most vigorous and fruitful among its peers. Today, we are each other's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade up 100-fold compared with 30 years ago. The accumulative amount of our bilateral direct investment exceeds US$310 billion.
 
Last year, China and ASEAN established a comprehensive strategic partnership. The two sides have deepened cooperation in green development, climate change, environmental protection, energy transition and the digital economy, and have worked together in implementing the Global Development Initiative and UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and in addressing risks to public health, food security, energy security and the financial sector.
 
Ten years ago, the ASEAN Summit started the RCEP negotiations. Today, the RCEP comes into force in 14 countries, forming the largest free trade area. The past decade reflects the essence of the China-ASEAN relationship, that is, we are good neighbors and close partners sharing weal and woe.
 
China firmly supports ASEAN as a driver of regional cooperation and appreciates Indonesia's emphasis that the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific is neither attached to nor targeted at any party. We will step up support for ASEAN integration and welcome ASEAN to formulate its post-2025 Community Vision.
 
As a valuable treasure, the ASEAN model embodies the oriental philosophy of how countries properly handle differences and disagreements. In the 1950s, the five principles of peaceful coexistence, initiated by China and Indonesia, ensured that countries, big or small, strong or weak, are entitled to peace.
 
In the past 50 years, regional countries have explored an ASEAN model based on the principles of mutual respect, consultation and accommodating the comfort levels of all parties. Positive thinking on common, cooperative and comprehensive security has been fostered, laying a solid foundation for stability in Asia.
 
At present, globalization faces headwinds, and voices for decoupling are growing louder. We should uphold true regional cooperation that unites countries within the region and remains open to those outside, and reject the fake one that keeps certain countries out and targets certain sides. We appreciate diversity among members, develop networks of friends worldwide with an open mindset, and reject any attempt to split the region into confrontational or exclusive groups.
 
We will advance negotiations on the new round of the China-ASEAN FTA upgrade, pursue synergies between Hainan Free Trade Port, Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and ASEAN development strategies, and support Hong Kong and Macao in more extensive cooperation with ASEAN members.
 
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. Over the decade, the synergies between the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and Indonesia's global maritime fulcrum have borne remarkable fruits. The Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway has finished a successful trial operation. Notable progress has been made in the 'two countries, twin parks' program. Our cooperation in the digital economy, green development and maritime projects has many highlights.
 
China has actively supported upgrading Indonesian industries. Our vaccine cooperation has grown from donation to coproduction and tech transfer. With China's support, Indonesia became the first country in Southeast Asia to master the mRNA vaccine production tech.
 
At Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park (IMIP), one Chinese tech professional teaches know-how to five to 10 Indonesian employees. Currently, the IMIP has created nearly 80,000 local jobs and paid $2.4 billion in tax to the Indonesian government.
 
Chinese enterprises actively fulfill their social responsibilities. Over 10,000 projects invested in by Chinese enterprises have created 250,000 local jobs. Some 91 percent of the Chinese-invested enterprises help local employees master skills through tech transfer, and 50 percent send Indonesian employees to China to receive training.
 
This year, China will hold the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. We welcome Indonesia in jointly building the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor to facilitate trade within the region. We are willing to import more quality goods from Indonesia and encourage more Chinese enterprises to invest here.
 
We are ready to strengthen cooperation in a low-carbon, circular and green economy. We stand ready to explore maritime economic cooperation, for example, marine products processing, tech support, environmental protection and port construction. And we are willing to advance synergies between the BRI, the Global Development Initiative and Indo-Pacific Outlook, to contribute more to regional poverty reduction and people-to-people ties.

107;Beyond trade: FDI as seeds for growth in China-ASEAN shared future;The Jakarta Post;2023-06-19 01:00:00;timezone unknown;http://www.thejakartapost.com/opinion/2023/06/19/beyond-trade-fdi-as-seeds-for-growth-in-china-asean-shared-future.html;thejakartapost.com;The changing landscape of China's manufacturing sector will present significant opportunities for ASEAN to capture some of China's manufacturing, and to become a major source of consumption for the…;"In 2013, President Xi Jinping, in a speech to Indonesia's parliament, announced an initiative for China to work with ASEAN countries for a 21st Century Maritime Silk Road to build together a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future.
 
For a decade, China and ASEAN have enjoyed growing connectivity, deepening economic integration and robust business ties.
 
Since 2020, ASEAN has surpassed the European Union to become China's largest trading partner, marking the official formation of a new regional economic and trade cooperation pattern in which China and ASEAN are each other's largest trading partners. Furthermore, China is the second highest contributor of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Indonesia.
 
In 2022, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) came into effect, which presented China a year-on-year trade increase of 15 percent with ASEAN.
 
As the two economies partnership continues to deepen, beyond trade, we expect to see China's growing footprint in ASEAN through FDI, planting seeds for growth in China and ASEAN's share future.
 
China and ASEAN, as two of the world's fastest growing regions, are highly complementary of industrial structures.
 
Southeast Asia enjoys strong manufacturing and production capacity, rising and young domestic consumer population, as well as increasing urbanization. The region's growing trade and capital flows, continuing digital transformation, and greater focus on sustainability are creating tremendous opportunities.
 
China's modern economy was built on the strength of a solid and often low-tech manufacturing sector, making it the world's single largest manufacturer today. As China continues to develop and move up the value chain – toward producing more high-tech manufactures and services and investing in more R&D – it is likely that some of the country's lower-tech, labor intensive manufacturing will be ‘up for grabs.
 
It is expected that ASEAN will emerge as the third pillar of Asian growth alongside China and India. The changing landscape of China's manufacturing sector will present significant opportunities for ASEAN to capture some of China's manufacturing, and to become a major source of consumption for the world.
 
The garment and textile industry is the most obvious candidate for moving production out of China to other Asian countries. There are also examples of intermediate-input and other tech manufacturing leaving China with countries like Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia picking up electronics work.
 
And as more companies seek geographic diversification and adopt the 'China+1' strategy, Southeast Asia will continue to gain market share – as well as a greater slice of global foreign direct investment as the center of gravity of global manufacturing continues to shift.
 
FDI flows into ASEAN as a percentage of total world flows rose to a record high of 11 percent in 2021, almost on par with China (12 percent). And China has become the joint largest source country for FDI into ASEAN (not counting intra-ASEAN) in 2021, on par with Japan. While the process was partially disrupted by the pandemic, after the re-opening, China's investment push into ASEAN will continue to thrive.
 
Most of mainland China's FDI projects in ASEAN in 2022 fall into sectors where recipient countries have a competitive advantage. Over the years, China has been investing heavily in ASEAN's booming manufacturing sector, ranging from the EV supply chain in Indonesia and Thailand, to consumer electronics in Vietnam, as well as Singapore's promising pharmaceuticals.
 
For example, Chinese investment has been key in facilitating Indonesia's nickel smelter boom, a key input for producing EV batteries. China-based CATL signed an agreement with Indonesia's state-owned enterprises PT Antam and PT Industri Baterai Indonesia (IBI) to jointly develop an almost US$6 billion mining-to-batteries ecosystem (Bloomberg, April 2022).
 
Indonesia is not the only candidate for China's FID along the EV supply chain. BYD, China's top EV producer, is planning to build a production center in Thailand, with a capacity of production of 150,000 EVs per annum. This will make Thailand its first production hub in ASEAN, partly thanks to the country's generous subsidy which is as much as 150,000 bahts ($4,340) per EV (Nikkei Asia, September 2022).
 
Elsewhere, China's investment in Malaysia is equally important. Risen Energy, China's solar energy firm, announced its first facility investment in Southeast Asia, worth $10 billion+ over 15 years, to manufacture high-efficiency photovoltaic modules.
 
Chinese firms have also made a move in Singapore. In late 2022, two Chinese firms, WuXi Biologics and WuXi AppTec, have announced a S$4 billion (US$2.98 billion) investment into the country's pharmaceutical manufacturing, the second-largest sub-sector after electronics.
 
The spreading supply chain across Asia is already resulting in increased capability and production quality in the countries closest to China. Continued investment, the right partnerships and new trade agreements such as the RCEP, will likely bring to the wider Southeast Asia region a degree of the economic advancement China has already been enjoying.
 
ASEAN has the potential to become one of the world's key manufacturing hubs. The region has favorable demographics, comparatively lower wages, is strategically located, and boasts production synergies. The opportunity for Southeast Asia countries to 'grab' some of China's manufacturing advantage is ripe. Yet to attract more global production and remain competitive with China, deeper efficiency improvements will need to be implemented in the region.
 
Despite the shadows cast by the global pandemic in the last few years and other market uncertainties, we see the coming years as a period of great promise for Southeast Asia, brimming with potentials ranging from sustainability and digital technology to trade and wealth. This also creates unprecedented opportunities for Chinese companies that are seeking continuous growth and global presence in the post-covid era.
 
The key to unlocking opportunities is not just to understand the dynamics of each market, but to understand how to help businesses across markets connect and work together - from the automotive sector in Thailand and electronic manufacturing in Malaysia to natural resources in Indonesia and pharmaceutical and financial services in Singapore.

108;CAREC Endorses Long-Term Strategy to Promote Safe, Sustainable, and Inclusive Tourism;https://www.facebook.com/AsianDevBank;2020-12-06 16:00:00;full;https://www.adb.org/news/carec-endorses-long-term-strategy-promote-safe-sustainable-and-inclusive-tourism;adb.org;Ministers and senior officials from the 11 member countries of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program have endorsed a new long-term strategy to promote safe, sustainable, and inclusive…;"News Release | 7 December 2020 MANILA, PHILIPPINES (7 December 2020) — Ministers and senior officials from the 11 member countries of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program have endorsed a new long-term strategy to promote safe, sustainable, and inclusive tourism development in the region, and enhance its attractiveness as a competitive tourism destination globally.
The CAREC Tourism Strategy 2030, presented at the 19th CAREC Ministerial Conference held virtually today, was endorsed by ministers and senior officials representing Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, the People's Republic of China (PRC), Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan also attended the meeting.
'The CAREC region is home to a wide range of historical and cultural heritage sites; unique gastronomy and local traditions; a rich, unexplored network of cities; and arresting natural endowments that traverse national boundaries,' said Asian Development Bank (ADB) Vice-President Shixin Chen, co-chair of the conference. 'Through the gradual implementation of regional initiatives, the CAREC Tourism Strategy 2030 will help the region bounce back from COVID-19 and establish itself as a sustainable, safe, and easily accessible tourism destination over the long term.'
In 2019, CAREC countries generated more than 420 million domestic tourists but only received 41 million foreign tourists. With the COVID-19 pandemic severely affecting global tourism in 2020, the CAREC Tourism Strategy 2030 accounts for the shift in travelers' preference towards closer, safer, and uncrowded destinations while outlining a long-term plan to develop the region as an easily accessible tourism destination that provides visitors with a variety of unique experiences.
The strategy provides a roadmap towards the enhancement of the region's connectivity through the harmonization of visa requirements and quality standards, simplification of border crossing procedures, and improvement of tourism infrastructure and facilities. It also focuses on tourism skills development while maximizing the use of digital technologies.
It aims to build a common brand, 'Visit Silk Road', through the creation of a CAREC tourism web portal and joint promotional activities for tour operators and other business providers. It seeks to develop unique tourism products and experiences catering to various segments including business, culture, nature and adventure, sun and beach holidays, health and wellness, and domestic weekenders.
'By fostering sustainable tourism growth in rural and urban areas, the new strategy will also help to reduce regional imbalances and empower local communities,' said ADB Director General for Central and West Asia Werner Liepach. 'It will promote gender equality by promoting jobs and income opportunities for private sector SMEs and entrepreneurs including women and young people.'
The CAREC Program is a partnership of 11 countries to promote economic growth and sustainable development through regional cooperation. It is supported by development partners including ADB, which serves as the Secretariat for the CAREC Program.

 SCHLOSS ELMAU, Germany – Group of Seven leaders pledged on Sunday, June 26, to raise $600 billion in private and public funds over five years to finance needed infrastructure in developing countries and counter China's older, multitrillion-dollar Belt and Road project. US President Joe Biden and other G7 leaders relaunched the newly renamed Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, at their annual gathering being held this year at Schloss Elmau in southern Germany. Biden said the United States would mobilize $200 billion in grants, federal funds, and private investment over five years to support projects in low- and middle-income countries that help tackle climate change as well as improve global health, gender equity, and digital infrastructure. 'I want to be clear. This isn't aid or charity. It's an investment that will deliver returns for everyone,' Biden said, adding that it would allow countries to 'see the concrete benefits of partnering with democracies.' Biden said hundreds of billions of additional dollars could come from multilateral development banks, development finance institutions, sovereign wealth funds, and others. Europe will mobilize 300 billion euros ($317.28 billion) for the initiative over the same period to build up a sustainable alternative to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) scheme, which Chinese President Xi Jinping launched in 2013, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the gathering. The leaders of Italy, Canada, and Japan also spoke about their plans, some of which have already been announced separately. French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson were not present, but their countries are also participating. China's investment scheme involves development and programs in over 100 countries aimed at creating a modern version of the ancient Silk Road trade route from Asia to Europe. White House officials said the plan has provided little tangible benefit for many developing countries. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian defended the track record of BRI when asked for comment at a daily briefing in Beijing on Monday, June 27. 'China continues to welcome all initiatives to promote global infrastructure development,' Zhao said of the G7's $600-billion plan. 'We believe that there is no question that various related initiatives will replace each other. We are opposed to pushing forward geopolitical calculations under the pretext of infrastructure construction or smearing the Belt and Road Initiative.' Biden highlighted several flagship projects, including a $2-billion solar development project in Angola with support from the Commerce Department, the US Export-Import Bank, US firm AfricaGlobal Schaffer, and US project developer Sun Africa. Together with G7 members and the EU, Washington will also provide $3.3 million in technical assistance to Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal as it develops an industrial-scale flexible multi-vaccine manufacturing facility in that country that can eventually produce COVID-19 and other vaccines, a project that also involves the EU. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) will also commit up to $50 million over five years to the World Bank's global Childcare Incentive Fund. Friederike Roder, vice president of the non-profit group Global Citizen, said the pledges of investment could be 'a good start' toward greater engagement by G7 countries in developing nations and could underpin stronger global growth for all. G7 countries on average provide only 0.32% of their gross national income, less than half of the 0.7% promised, in development assistance, she said. 'But without developing countries, there will be no sustainable recovery of the world economy,' she said. – Rappler.com $1 = 0.9455 euros";rappler.com;3678;business;PH;en;;https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/06/g7-summit-june-26-2022-reuters-001.jpg;False;@rapplerdotcom;19.28261;9918978282e24f974f8bc279180921f3;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 2}

During his visit to Xinjiang from Tuesday to Friday, Chinese President Xi Jinping called the multi-ethnic region ""a hub"" in Belt and Road cooperation.  Xinjiang has morphed from a relatively enclosed hinterland into the forefront of opening-up, the president told staff at Urumqi International Land Port Area on Tuesday afternoon, as the country is promoting the expansion of opening up, the development of the western regions, and the joint efforts in building the Belt and Road. President Xi stressed advancing the building of the core area of the Silk Road Economic Belt - the ""belt"" component of the BRI - and incorporating Xinjiang's regional opening-up strategy into the country's overall plan of westward development. The gateways At the international land port area, Xi checked the operations of China-Europe Railway Express (Urumqi), the Alashankou port and the Horgos Port, which are all important gateways for cross-border trade. Horgos, literally translates to ""a place where caravans pass,"" used to be a trading post along the northern route of the ancient Silk Road.  In 2016, the port launched the China-Europe freight train service and has since witnessed a steady rise in the number of trains passing through it. Despite of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of China-Europe freight trains entering and leaving via Horgos Port exceeded 4,720 in 2020, a 43 percent increase compared with the total in 2019. According to local customs officials, the services of the China-Europe freight train have been favored by an increasing number of companies during the pandemic thanks to their low prices, large transportation capacity, great stability and connectivity. The Alashankou Port, also known as Alataw Pass, is China's closest railway port to Europe. In January 2020, cross border e-commerce was launched in the inland port and commodities like toys, digital products and clothing manufactured in the country have been shipped to Europe since. Data from the customs of the inland port shows that more than 57 million cross-border e-commerce packages worth over 1 billion yuan (about 160 million U.S. dollars) have been exported via the port since January 2020. During his inspection, Xi also highlighted the importance of innovating the system for an open economy, the building of large corridors, better utilizing both domestic and international markets and resources, and actively serving and integrating into the new pattern of development. China put forth the West Development Strategy in 1999, and since then, the country's western regions have achieved remarkable progress. The accelerating GDP growth in western China has suggested a narrowing development gap between the country's east and west. https://news.cgtn.com/news/2022-07-16/Xinjiang-a-hub-in-Belt-and-Road-cooperation-1bHN4QKUUgw/index.html";asiaone.com;4002;business;SG;en;;https://www.asiaone.com/ico.png;False;@asiaonecom;25.179436;beb32d3382895fe01779be3f0b7c0168;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 2}

It has also been the first international forum comprising mostly offline conferences this year. Alex Ju, Founder and CEO of Chindata Group (NASDAQ: CD), the only carrier-neutral digital infrastructure platform in the Asia-Pacific region, was invited to attend the annual conference of Boao Forum for Asia (BFA). At a session titled ""Building up New Infrastructure with Digital Silk Road"", he shared his thoughts on how to give full play to the cross-cultural, cross-regional and cross-industrial advantages as an international company and how to advance its strategic layout in the regions influenced by RCEP pact. He believed that this strategy will not only empower the leading tech companies with evolving digital infrastructure but also make its contribution for people in this region to equally enjoy the benefits of digital transformation. Mr.Ju said that the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) can accelerate the Belt and Road initiative to achieve a five-way progress in policy communication, infrastructure connectivity, trade facilitation, capital flow, and people-to-people exchanges. In the digital age, as digitization levels of the five-way progress are getting higher and higher, there are rising requirements for the interconnection of digital infrastructure. To better support the rapid development of digital economy, the digital infrastructure planning and construction needs to implement as quickly as it could as the preparing period usually takes one or two years. By the end of the fourth quarter of 2020, Chindata Group had a total of 489 IT MW capacity in service and under construction, focusing in China, Malaysia, India and other Asia-Pacific countries. Chindata Group received over 40 IT MW of indication of interest (IOI) orders for its Southeast Asia facilities from anchor tenants in the fourth quarter of 2020. The leading cloud service providers expanded their cooperation with Chindata Group to include contracts for an additional 16.35 IT MW in Malaysia and an additional 10 IT MW in India. Facing the impact of coronavirus in 2020, Chindata Group was the only digital infrastructure operator in the world that could delivers services on schedule to its top global cloud companies, strongly supporting their business development in the countries RCEP includes and helping them promote the local digital economy too. ""There is no shortcut to building the Digital Silk Road. Only by deeply participating in this industry and upholding the role of a supporter can we truly deliver the contribution to the sustainable development of the local country's digital economy industry."" Mr. Ju said. On the sidelines of the Boao Forum for Asia, Mr. Ju also met with Mr. Djauhari Oratmangun, Ambassador of the Republic of Indonesia to the People's Republic and envoys and counselors of many other member countries related to RCEP. They exchanged in-depth views on topics such as Chindata Group's business plan in RCEP-related countries and the role of RCEP in promoting digital infrastructure.

To strengthen the Belt and Road countries to share new opportunities in the digital era and further strengthen international meteorological cooperation, the index started research in May 2020 with the support of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA). The index is to provide analysis on meteorological development of the ASEAN countries, according to Zhong Guoping, head of Guangxi Meteorological Bureau, noting that it can provide digital references for further cooperation in the meteorological sector between China and the ASEAN countries. Xu Xiaofeng, head of the China Meteorological Service Association (CMS), said that the China-ASEAN Meteorological Development Index gathered multiple high-quality resources and collaborative innovations, laying a solid foundation for deepening international cooperation in the field of meteorology. The index report showed that Laos had continuously improved its ability to prevent and reduce weather disasters and respond to changes in weather, with its weather forecast accuracy and other related indicators meeting the modern standard, said Li Xiao, China-ASEAN chief analyst with CEIS, China's leading economic information service provider affiliated to Xinhua News Agency. The 6th China Meteorological Equipment & Service Exhibition is part of the 18th China-ASEAN Expo held during Sept. 10-13.

As a new driving force for global economic growth, the digital economy has great significance. The added value of the digital economy in 47 countries around the world reached $38.1 trillion in 2021, with an increase of 15.6 percent year on year, according to a report titled ""World Internet Development Report 2022"". Against this background, China on Wednesday called on G20 members to make joint efforts in invigorating digital cooperation so as to let the fruits of the development of the digital economy benefit people of all countries. Building global digital economic paradigm China stands ready to continue cooperating with the G20 members to jointly build a global digital economic paradigm featuring benefits for all, balance, coordination, inclusiveness, win-win cooperation and common prosperity, said Chinese President Xi Jinping when attending and addressing the summit in Indonesia's resort island of Bali. Multilateralism must be upheld, Xi stressed, calling for strengthened international cooperation. Noting that development should be prioritized, the Chinese president said the digital gap must be bridged and innovation should serve as the driving force for promoting post-pandemic recovery. During the 2016 Hangzhou G20 Summit, China for the first time put the digital economy on the G20 agenda, vowing to innovate development patterns and tap growth potential. At the following summits of the group in 2017 and 2018, world leaders also held extensive discussions on how to strengthen cooperation in developing the digital economy while addressing the challenges brought about by new technologies. During these years, multiple G20 summits have made it clear that the digital economy is an increasingly important driver of global economic growth, and the G20, which includes the world's major economies, represents the leading force in the development of the digital economy. China in action The Chinese president also underlined that China will continue to work with G20 members to foster a ""balanced, coordinated and inclusive"" global digital economy landscape that brings benefits to all and features win-win cooperation and shared prosperity. China has launched the initiative of building a Digital Silk Road, and has identified digital economy as a key area of cooperation under the Global Development Initiative, according to Xi. China has proposed the G20 Action Plan on Digital Innovation and Cooperation, which is aimed at promoting the innovative application of digital technology and making innovation outcomes beneficial to all and shared by all, and welcomes the participation of all parties, Xi said. China, as the world's second largest economy and the largest developing country, has attached great importance to developing the digital economy, and its digital development will inject new impetus into global economic recovery and create new opportunities for common development. Over the past decade, China has witnessed remarkable progress in its digital economy, the value of which reached 45.5 trillion yuan (about $6.3 trillion) in 2021, accounting for 39.8 percent of the country's GDP, according to a report released by the Chinese Academy of Cyberspace Studies on November 9. By June 2022, there were 1.05 billion internet users in China, and the internet penetration rate had reached 74.4 percent, read a white paper titled ""Jointly Build a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace"" released by China's State Council Information Office on November 7. The country hosts the world's largest 5G network and is one of the global leaders in 5G standards and technology, with 1.85 million 5G cell towers and 455 million 5G cell phone subscribers, according to the white paper. Still, the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) and long-range objectives through 2035, which map out a blueprint for the country's new journey toward the full construction of a modern socialist country, makes it clear that China will continue to put efforts in promoting the digital economy. The country aims to raise the proportion of the added value of core digital economy industries in its GDP to 10 percent in 2025, up from 7.8 percent in 2020, according to the plan. By 2025, China will see the digital transformation of industries reach a new level, digital public services will become more inclusive, and the digital economy governance system will improve noticeably, as per the plan. https://news.cgtn.com/news/2022-11-16/China-calls-for-digital-cooperation-to-boost-global-economic-recovery-1f0OuLDSeCQ/index.html";asiaone.com;4002;business;SG;en;;https://media.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/styles/a1_600x316/public/original_images/Nov2022/pr-newswire_500_4_1171.jpg?h=7de12b8a&itok=9ddIYmLg;False;@asiaonecom;20.259825;6609d4862722864182836d82e71592a0;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 2}

The report was released by the Jiangsu Center of Xinhua-run China Economic Information Service (CEIS) on the expo's future of smart media-themed sub-forum. It probes into the characteristics, effectiveness and shortcomings of Suzhou's city image building via internet channels in the past year. Chen Xixi, head of Jiangsu Center of CEIS releases the annual report on Thursday. Suzhou, as one of the major cities in the Yangtze River Delta, boasts a unique city image thanks to its world-class traditional culture and rich aquatic resources, complete and diversified manufacturing industry chain, and advantages in piloting preferential and opening-up policies by national level local economic platforms, according to the report. Different from other Chinese cities, Suzhou appeared in reports by global media with four typical characteristics. For instance, the city was usually reported along with such hot words as the ""digital city"", ""ancient Chinese gardens"", and words related to urban construction, culture, and tourism of Suzhou. Moreover, Suzhou mainly appeared in reports by global mainstream media, which are mostly neutral in stance, in topics regarding its ecological environment, science and technology progresses, and development of emerging industries. Furthermore, the city caught more attention from traditional media such as magazines, news agencies and commercial news websites and new media as compared with social media where reports about Suzhou are relatively scarce. YouTube turned out a more interactive and influential platform for the city to communicate with the world as it is easy for influencer campaigns to produce widely-focused livestreaming shows about Suzhou, and the audiovisual language and topics concerned are easy to understand and closer to daily life. All of these resulted from Suzhou's continuous efforts in city image building in recent years, which highlighted its international communication with more cultural factors and established an all-round and multidimentional communication mode. To better tell Suzhou stories, the report suggests the city deepening cognition of its city image and exploring more value of its connotation.

As the founder of a start-up firm, Peng noted that we are now in an era of technology-led entrepreneurship. Crossing the border from the internet to the realm of life sciences, he said that it behooves one and all to keep making future-oriented, innovative, ground-breaking discoveries and putting them into practice. Rome was not built in a day. Influential innovations are the rewards for those who continuously invested in this sector. At the first Brain Sciences Theme Forum of 2022 World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) that just took place in September, NeuroXess launched its first integrated cranial parietal semi-implantable medical-grade brain-computer interface (BCI), a high-frequency EEG signal processor bundled together with a software and algorithm cloud platform. Peng said that the company has built up considerable expertise in related technologies and products. In his presentation on the company's core technology, he noted, ""Our cortical electrodes and flexible deep electrodes featuring MEMS micro and nano technology are greatly superior to traditional medical devices both in terms of technical indicators and the size and flexibility of the electrode."" In addition, NeuroXess is using silk protein as the wrapping material to assist the implantation of the electrodes. Peng said that this approach reduces the trauma and damage to the brain that can take place during the implantation process, while the material itself is more easily degradable and is a safer implantation aid. He continued, ""At present, with our BCI devices, chips for signal collecting and processing are able to support channel addressing for a 16,000-channel chip and the simultaneous acquisition of 2000 channels. This is the feature that really sets our chips apart."" Peng said that the company's newly-released algorithm cloud platform facilitates leveraging the capabilities of the Internet, AI, and cloud computing to analyze digital EEG signals, enabling the continuous overlay and sharing of algorithms and data on the cloud. He described it as similar to Tesla's self-driving function: the more cars there are on the road, the more accurate the L4 algorithm will be. Eventually, we will form a closed loop in the EEG algorithm, and the more people use it, the more accurate our final decoding algorithm will become. From September to December, 16 senior investors from Sequoia China and 40+ entrepreneurs from companies at the forefront of innovation will be invited to discuss the intersection of technology and healthcare, and discover and put into practice the breakthrough innovations that can guide our future by examining the best examples of existing achievements.";asiaone.com;4002;business;SG;en;;https://media.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/styles/a1_600x316/public/original_images/Nov2022/image_153.jpg?h=c4abd45d&itok=yN6jFj00;False;@asiaonecom;17.74969;5d4e609691e94d956400c87d561e8ad8;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 2}

High-quality international investment and trade pioneer From being one of the five trading ports in China 100 years ago to being one of the earliest special economic zones in the country, Xiamen has always been a window for China to open to the outside world, playing an important role in the history of the country's opening up. Over the past 41 years, the city has taken an initiative to integrate into the global economy and implemented an open strategy producing mutually beneficial results. As a result, an all-around, wide-ranging, and multilevel pattern of opening up to the outside world has taken shape in Xiamen. The city includes special economic zones, Taiwan investment areas, export processing zones, bonded zones, pilot comprehensive reform zones, and free trade pilot zones. Xiamen itself is a pivot city involved in the BRI. Thanks to CIFIT, Xiamen has gained a broader international vision, open concept, and development opportunities, which further prompted the city to build a new pattern of opening up, as well as promote the high-quality development of its export-oriented economy. Xiamen gained fruitful results at the 20th CIFIT in 2018. ""Xiamen's securing of many key projects reflects the vitality of CIFIT, as well as the approval of investors of the investment environment in China and Xiamen,"" sad Dai Lesheng, deputy director of the Xiamen commerce bureau. ""It will promote Xiamen's construction of a high-quality innovation and entrepreneurial city, as well as an international garden city."" In the first seven months of the year, there were 72 overseas investment projects in Xiamen and the city's contracted investment value totaled $2.43 billion, higher than the same period last year. Statistics from Xiamen Customs show that in July, the monthly import and export value in Xiamen exceeded 80 billion yuan ($12.39 billion) for the first time to 81.29 billion yuan, with a record year-on-year increase of 30.1 percent.

 /PRNewswire/ -- A news report from China Report ASEAN: Over the last 10 years since the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was proposed, the scale of financing under the framework has been expanding, and channels for financing have been diversifying, supporting construction of major projects and motivating countries along the route to work together to build a stable and diversified financing system. The Chinese yuan has enjoyed increasing influence. As trade and economic cooperation between 
China
 and ASEAN is growing in both quality and efficiency, settlement in local currency has been adopted in more transactions, laying a solid foundation for the development of the BRI.
 
Diversified Financing
 
Wang Zhimin, a research fellow with the Academy of China Open Economy Studies and director of the Institute of Globalization and 
China's
 Modernization at 
Beijing
-based University of International Business and Economics, called financial connectivity indispensable support for joint efforts to advance high-quality BRI development. It is the foundation for realizing trade and infrastructure connectivity and reinforces efforts to achieve policy and people-to-people connectivity.
 
Statistics from 
China's
 Ministry of Commerce showed that from January to 
April 2023
, non-financial direct investment by Chinese businesses in countries along the Belt and Road totaled 
US$7.53 billion
, up 9 percent year on year. Over the period, Chinese businesses finished contracted projects worth 
US$23.05 billion
 and signed new contracts worth 
US$29.74 billion
 in countries along the route, accounting for 54.9 percent and 50.2 percent of the total, respectively.
 
Tu Yonghong
, a professor with the School of Finance at Renmin University of 
China
, said that entities participating in financial connectivity mainly include participating countries' central banks, commercial banks, securities firms, and insurance companies as well as emerging multilateral development financial institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Silk Road Fund. Together, they have formed a diversified financing system to serve BRI construction.   
 
By the end of 2022, with membership rising to 106, the AIIB had granted funding for 202 projects, totaling 
US$28.8 billion
. The Silk Road Fund had signed funding agreements for more than 70 projects, committing investment of around 
US$21.5 billion
, with 70 percent going to countries along the Belt and Road route to fund infrastructure projects and projects for resource development and production capacity cooperation.
 
Chinese financial institutions have been the main driving force fostering financial connectivity under the BRI framework, and their role has been central. In 2017, 
China
 and six multilateral development institutions including the Asian Development Bank, the AIIB, and the World Bank signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Collaboration on Matters of Common Interest Under the Belt and Road Initiative. In 2019, they agreed to jointly build a Multilateral Cooperation Center for Development Finance. By the end of 2020, a total of 11 Chinese-funded banks had set up close to 80 subsidiaries in 29 countries along the Belt and Road.
 
At the fifth 
China
-
Singapore
 (
Chongqing
) Connectivity Initiative Financial Summit, 
China
 and 
Singapore
 signed 90 contracts on major projects with contract value totaling 
111 billion yuan
 (
US$15.35 billion
). Breakthroughs were made in issuance of overseas yuan-denominated bonds and cross-border assignment of credit. By the end of 
March 2023
, cross-border financial projects under the framework of 
China

Singapore
 connectivity cooperation reached 
US$19.6 billion
 in value, benefiting more than 10 Chinese provincial-level regions including 
Chongqing
, 
Guangxi
, 
Sichuan
, and 
Yunnan
.
 
Josephine Teo
, Minister for Communications and Information and Second Minister for Home Affairs, said at the summit that strengthening financial cooperation and connectivity will help lower business costs and facilitate financing, risk management, and assets management. She added that it will promote China-ASEAN trade and economic development and cross-border investment and tap the regional potential to the full.
 
Wang Zhimin stressed that countries along the Belt and Road have huge demand for infrastructure financing, but the cost of financing is high and the local financial market is less developed. ""Bridging the financial gap calls for joint efforts from various sectors,"" Wang said. 
Tu Yonghong
 echoed those sentiments. She suggested continuous efforts to open the financial sector and build an institutional system to navigate financial risks. In the meantime, a regular financing mechanism would promote coordinated development of the financial chain and industrial chains, she said, adding that greater support should be given to new business models.
 
New Explorations in International Settlements
 
On 
April 4, 2023
, 
Malaysia's
 Prime Minister 
Anwar Ibrahim
 proposed launching an Asian Monetary Fund. On 
April 13
, Brazilian President 
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva
 delivered a speech at the headquarters of the BRICS New Development Bank in 
Shanghai
. He passionately posed a series of questions. ""Why do all countries have to base their trade on the dollar?"" ""Why can't we trade with our own currencies?""
 
Some have begun
 to seek alternative currency for international settlement and increased efforts to diversify their international reserve assets portfolio.
 
Tu Yonghong
 said that the fall of dollar hegemony doesn't mean that the Chinese yuan will replace the U.S. dollar, but it instead presents opportunities for the internationalization of the Chinese yuan. In recent years, the Chinese yuan has been a robust and resilient currency in the international market, and its appeal to international investors is on the rise.  
 
In 
May 2022
, the International Monetary Fund raised the Chinese yuan's weighting in the Special Drawing Right from 10.92 percent to 12.28 percent, the third highest among all currencies. SWIFT statistics showed that in 
February 2023
, international payment in the Chinese yuan accounted for around 2.19 percent of the world total, the fifth largest share among all currencies worldwide.
 
In late March, the Brazilian government said that it had reached an agreement with 
China
, promising it will no longer use the U.S. dollar as the currency in trade with 
China
. Instead, local currencies will be used in bilateral trade settlement. On 
April 26
, the Argentinian government announced that it would pay for Chinese imports in Chinese yuan. On 
May 16
, the liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier Marweh from the 
United Arab Emirates
 (UAE) finished unloading at a port in south 
China's
 
Guangdong Province
, marking the completion of 
China's
 first cross-border yuan-settled LNG trade.
 
In 2021, cross-border payment in Chinese yuan between 
China
 and countries along the Belt and Road totaled 
5.42 trillion yuan
 (
US$747.84 billion
), up 19.6 percent year on year. Wang Zhimin noted that although the Chinese yuan's credibility and appeal are on the rise, particularly in countries along the Belt and Road, it still has a long way to go to become an international currency. More efforts are needed in terms of composite national strength, financial market foundation, and institutional discourse.
 
In recent years, digital currency, based on decentralized block chain technology, has been shaking the dollar-denominated cross-border payment system to a certain degree. It also raised eyebrows in many countries by breaking geographical border restrictions and featuring low cost and high efficiency.
 
Central banks of more than 60 countries worldwide are studying and experimenting with digital currencies. 
China's
 central bank, the People's Bank of 
China
 (PBC), established a research team on fiat digital currency as early as in 2014, setting focus on key technology, the environment for the issuance and circulation of digital currency, and related international experience. In 
February 2021
, the PBC joined its counterparts in 
Thailand
 the UAE, and other countries to launch the Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency (m-CBDC) Bridge Project. Currently in the trial phase, the m-CBDC bridge project is expected to create a direct connection network for central banks and business partners and form an independent system for international payment and settlement.
 
Tu Yonghong
 said that digital currency is a result of the rapidly growing digital economy and an inevitable outcome of efforts to deepen supply-side reform in the financial sector and facilitate integrated development of the financial sector and the digital economy. She called the m-CBDC bridge project a demonstration of significance but admitted it faces problems including huge differences in technological levels and government regulation.
 
Cross-border Trade Settled in Local Currencies
 
China
 and ASEAN countries are geographically and culturally adjacent. Since the BRI was launched, trade between 
China
 and ASEAN countries has been growing, creating conditions for monetary and financial cooperation. 
China
 and ASEAN are each other's largest trading partner. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) taking effect bolstered 
China
 and ASEAN's future in trade and investment cooperation, said Wang Zhimin. Implementation of new projects will kindle greater demand for financial connectivity and open new ground for the monetary and financial market, Wang added.
 
According to the PBC's 2022 report on the internationalization of the Chinese yuan, by the end of 2021, 
China
 had signed bilateral currency swap agreements with 22 countries along the Belt and Road including 
Indonesia
, 
Malaysia
, 
Thailand
, 
Singapore
, and 
Laos
. The Cross-border Interbank Payment System in Chinese yuan has been available across ASEAN member states. According to the 2022 report on the use of the Chinese yuan in ASEAN member states released by the Financial Society of 
Guangxi
, cross-border transactions between 
China
 and ASEAN settled in Chinese yuan totaled 
4.8 trillion yuan
 (
US$662 billion
) in 2021, up 16 percent year on year. The figure multiplied by close to 20-fold over the last 10 years, said the report.
 
Tu Yonghong
 said that currency circulation is inextricably associated with trade ties. Agreements on currency swaps and cross-border payment and settlement mitigate the risk of foreign exchange volatility, increase the liquidity of Chinese yuan in overseas markets, and creates conditions for trade facilitation, Tu said, adding that these effectively facilitate the flow of capital, technology and talent and will further boost trade and economic cooperation between 
China
 and ASEAN.
 
Wang Huiyao, president of the Center for 
China
 and Globalization, said at the fifth 
China
-
Singapore
 (
Chongqing
) Connectivity Initiative Financial Summit that 
China
 and ASEAN have primarily built necessary infrastructure for financial connectivity. From 2009 to 2021, the scale of bilateral currency swaps between 
China
 and ASEAN member states went up from 
180 billion yuan
 (
US$24.84 billion
) to 
800 billion yuan
 (
US$110.38 billion
), a 3.4-fold increase. Seizing opportunities brought by RCEP and conducting more cooperation on mutual recognition of financial standards, data sharing, and data flow are crucial.
 
Alongside cooperation with 
China
, ASEAN member states are seeking cross-border settlements in local currencies. On 
March 28
, treasury ministers and central bank governors of ASEAN member states met in 
Indonesia
. The primary agenda of the meeting was to discuss reducing dependence on the U.S. dollar, Euro, Japanese yen, and pound for financial transactions and how to settle transactions in local currencies.
 
At the 42nd ASEAN Summit, ASEAN member states adopted the ASEAN Leaders' Declaration on Advancing Regional Payment Connectivity and Promoting Local Currency Transaction, pledging to engage and collaborate with ASEAN's external partners, international organizations, and the private sectors, advance regional payment connectivity by utilizing emerging opportunities brought by innovation, encourage the use of local currencies for cross-border transactions, and support establishment of a task force to explore the development of an ASEAN Local Currency Transaction Framework.
 
On 
May 8
, Bank Indonesia and Bank Negara Malaysia (
Malaysia's
 central bank) announced the commercial launch of the 
Indonesia
-
Malaysia
 cross-border quick response (QR) code payment linkage. Before that, 
Indonesia
, 
Malaysia
, 
the Philippines
, 
Thailand
, and 
Singapore
 signed agreements to launch such a cross-border QR code payment linkage. Perry Warjiyo, governor of Bank Indonesia, said cross-border QR code payment provides users more options and is key to enhancing efficiency, boosting the digital economy, fostering inclusive financial development in the region, and safeguarding macro-financial stability.
 
Tu Yonghong
 said that using local currency for trade settlement is vitally important for the development of national economies and market stability. However, because the trade volume between ASEAN member states is small and different member states use different currencies, building unified standards for the financial markets in ASEAN member states has been difficult.";asiaone.com;4002;business;SG;en;;https://media.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/styles/a1_600x316/public/original_images/Aug2023/pr-newswire_500_4_552.jpg?h=7de12b8a&itok=96B7YU7o;False;@asiaonecom;17.081987;5b07bcab44a24eab76ab92be9a4374c0;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 2}

According to announcement made earlier, Brillink was granted an In-Principle Approval Letter (the ""AIP Letter"") on 4 December 2020 to be formed for a licence to carry on banking services. The issuance of official licence to Brillink has demonstrated regulator's confidence in Brillink's development of banking business.Since last year, the ""black swan"" COVID-19 has swept the world and has made a huge impact on various countries. Hence, new trends have emerged. The penetration of digitization and intelligence has accelerated. As for financial sector, the development of digital banking is booming, which brings incredible business opportunities and becomes a new battlefield in the financial industry. CBG combines the existing real economy business with the new digital bank to build a new scenario for the digital bank focus on supply chain. According to the company's previous announcement, the bank is expected to start trial operation in the second half of 2021, and may own the world's first digital bank focusing on supply chain finance. In addition, the latest review result of Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) shows that CBG has been included in the MSCI Hong Kong Micro Index in November 2020. Such relevant adjustment was made and be effective on 30 November 2020, after the market closed.Statistics show that the MSCI Hong Kong Micro Index is constructed in a comprehensive and consistent manner and is one of the most widely used stock benchmarks used by institutional investors to measure the performance of investment portfolios. The index is currently covering thousands of stocks with good operating performance and potential from different regions and different market capitalizations. In other words, being included in the market benchmark index reflects the capital market's full confidence in CBG's development and prospects.You can never imagine CBG's business development strategy before reading the news mentioned above. Now, how should we view the real investment value hidden behind it?Obtained A Full Banking License to Create A New Imagination First, let's sort out the basic situation of the proposed digital bank so that you can clarify its business positioning and audience.According to an announcement made by CBG, it acquired the issued share capital of CBG Fintech Holdings Limited twice in 2020 through its wholly-owned subsidiary CFSG, and finally obtained 80% of the issued share capital of CBG Fintech Holdings Limited in order to expand its banking business.According to public information, Kazakhstan is striving to build AIFC into a leading financial centre in Asia, and through China's ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative to develop AIFC into an important offshore RMB centre. As a result, the digital bank for supply chain financing will have significant location investment advantages and market competitive advantages after its landing.From the perspective of market competition, leading financial institutions such as China Development Bank, China Construction Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, and China International Capital Corporation have all settled in AIFC. Shanghai Stock Exchange and Silk Road Fund have also jointly invested in AIFC stock exchange (AIX), and owns 25% and 5% of AIX respectively. Possessing a full bank license issued by AIFC enables Brillink to become one of the formal, and global-oriented international financial institutions, and enables it to provide customers with one-stop supply chain financial services.Besides, according to related research reports, the average online channel usage of global digital bank users has increased by more than 35% in the past three years, especially in Asia, where online transactions are well developed with digital bank customers reaching 1.7 billion in 2020. Moreover, after the outbreak of the epidemic, powerful companies continued to promote digital transformation and upgrading. In addition, with the booming of ""New Infrastructure"" led by national policies, the novel form of digital banking has been accelerated in the B-end and C-end at the same time.However, the current market situation is that most of the leading companies have concentrated on the C-end market, while few companies will really focus on the B-end market and have the ability to take the lead in the B-end market.We believe that digital banks with the abilities to develop B-end business are more likely to stand out in the market. Undoubtedly, it is a good timing for Brillink to intervene at this moment.Specifically, Brillink's B-end business covers the entire supply chain, mainly for high-quality customers in the IC and 5G industries, and has certain differences between the inclusive financial model that combines with the more common individuals and SME audiences in the market. Digital banks with such a background are even rarer. Under the wave of empowering the real economy, they are more likely to seize market opportunities.As mentioned before, Brillink is the one of the few fintech company that will start digital banking at AIFC and obtains full license for deposits and loans. In view of this, the company's digital banking business is likely to give priority to seizing the market, rapidly expanding the company's sources of income, and opening up a new imagination for CBG to the market.Strategic Planning and Resources Create High Synergies, Resulting in Strong and Promising FutureAs we all know, to provide financial digital banking services for related companies by focusing on the supply chain can better serve the real economy and promote more efficient trade operation and circulation. The development path of focusing on advanced and technology-led high-end manufacturing or smart manufacturing industry chains such as 5G communications and electronic consumer product manufacturing, will conforms to the general trend of national development and the huge market of independent and self-controlled semiconductors. With its technical and capital barriers, and the threshold of high efficiency, the financial supply chain digital banking business have important characteristics, including irreplaceable and large-scale output.Other than the competitive environment of the industry, investors also need to focus on the synergies brought by the supply chain resources of CBG.Mr. Zhang Chunhua, the actual controller of CBG, is also the actual controller of China Brilliant Supply Chain Services Co. Limited(""CB""). CB, founded in 2006, is one of the first supply chain companies in the country to position on industrial supply chains. CB is the first batch of advanced technology service enterprises in Shenzhen. In recent years, it has won the honour of the best innovative enterprise in China's supply chain management. It has won the China IC market supply chain service award for four consecutive years. It has also been recognized as a national service-oriented manufacturing demonstration platform, which has fully affirmed CB's value and outstanding performance in serving the industry, and demonstrated CB's position as a leader in the supply chain field.In the past 15 years since CB's establishment, its cumulative revenue has exceeded 113 billion dollars, cumulative tax payment has exceeded 40.5 billion dollars (including tariffs), and the total import and export of general trade has exceeded 55.6 billion US dollars. Its business covers more than 200 large and medium-sized cities in China, and reaching North America, South America, South Asia, Africa and other countries and regions. It has served over 10,000 high-quality customers in the upstream and downstream of the 5G, IC manufacturing, mobile phone manufacturing and other multi-industry chains, by providing one-stop supply chain services including cross-border comprehensive management services, global logistics solutions, meticulous industrial storage and financial supply chain.It is worth noting that with such a large business scale and an operation mode of high proportion of supply chain financing, CB has an extremely low rate of bad debts since its opening, and its risk management and control capabilities are evident. These excellent customers and valuable business experience will be passed on to Brillink and its digital banking business with great probability. These above key points can be reasonably deduced, and the more important ones can be reflected in the following aspects.On the one hand, the digital banking business can give full play to CB's ability of transforming high-end B-end customers, including Xiaomi, Samsung, Siemens, Panasonic, ASM, Transsion, Huaqin, CVTE, Changhong, Cambrian and other top customer resources.On the other hand, the bad debt rate of import and export loans has always been low, which is 65 times lower than the bad debt rate of general corporate loans. The cloud computing technology and the analysis ability of corporate credit rating big data that CB has accumulated for 15 years can provide the basic support for its digital banking business. From the top to the bottom of the capital supply end, to the capital demand end, it has formed a closed loop of the supply chain financial industry, and thus the risks of engaging in this type of loan business are relatively more controllable.From the above points of view, CB's strategic planning of digital bank business can create a high synergy development effect with the Group's existing supply chain business. It is not just a simple coincidence of customer groups. The Group's past import and export supply chain business also involved a large amount of supply chain financing. CB has mature experience in trade settlement, risk control, and specific operations. These are all available for reference for Brillink, and attain its business transformation smoothly.In addition, there are bound to be a large number of potential customers in the customer resource network that the company has built, such as the many upstream and downstream suppliers of high-end industrial giants. Under such ""direct and indirect"" conversion model, the company's future customer volume and market space will be immeasurable.With the support of a good front-end business platform like CB, the digital banking business of CBG will never lack the stamina for development.Core Assets Support High Valuations and Reveal Market Investment Value With reference to the previous performance of financial platforms driven by technology, there have always been giants and unicorns, and no ""dwarfs"".We have sorted out the valuations of a number of digital banks with financing records, where we can see that many companies have the characteristics of good profitability and super high valuations, especially Chinese companies that operate online business like WeBank.Looking back at the fundamentals of Brillink.In terms of business logic, its parent group's supply chain business gathers high-quality customers in fast-growing and highly professional industries such as 5G, IC manufacturing, and mobile phone manufacturing, with huge conversion opportunities. These can allow Brillink lower customer cost, sufficient customer stickiness and considerable room for growth. Furthermore, the purely online business model can effectively reduce service costs, eliminate high investment on offline branches and fixed asset, and reduce cost-to-income ratios. With the company's low bad debt rate under effective risk control, and high gross profit margins, the return on business investment (or return on net assets) is expected to be quite impressive.Looking ahead, Brillink has a clear development path and high visibility. It will benefit from tides of the times and national policies, such as the increasingly active investment in the ""Belt and Road"" initiative, New Infrastructure, the trend of autonomous control of 5G and semiconductors, as well as its parent company's improving supply chain business services, with the increasing types and numbers of vertical industries and the re-expansion of service boundaries.Therefore, we believe that CBG, to a certain extent, has the possibility of transferring to the Main Board and owns basic strength, due to its high-value core assets. As the first global/ Hong Kong stock with the concept of financial supply chain digital bank, it has a certain degree of scarcity, together with the imagination brought by its long-term development potential, there are many good reasons to judge that CBG's digital bank assets will eventually enjoy a valuation premium. Compared with its current valuation level, the premium space appears to be quite sufficient. Investors can follow up to the timing and announcement of continuing to attract strategic investors and the trend of smart money. Copyright 2021 ACN Newswire.

Action Plan on Creating New Advantages for Xiamen's Business Environment to Facilitate the High-Quality Development of Enterprises
.
The aim of the policy is to inject impetus into the high-quality development of the country.
The business environment of a city, which is closely related to its core competitiveness, plays a crucial role in the survival and development of enterprises. The plan is benchmarked against the highest international standards and uses market entities' sense of gain as the main evaluation standard.
With the goal of stimulating market vitality and bolstering high-level opening-up and innovation, the new policy contains 126 specific tasks for 28 major aspects, including constructing a competitive and orderly market, creating a fair and just legal environment, and strengthening internal and external circulation.
Under the plan, Xiamen will innovate every aspect of the business environment, build a system for policy promotion and precise service, and establish a mechanism to monitor the satisfaction of market entities.
For instance, some innovative measures highlighted in the plan include promoting the ""one matter, one time"" handling of the life-cycle matters for individuals and enterprises, launching a trial reform of multi-mode transportation bills of lading, and further integrating Xiamen Port's information system and data resources to facilitate customs clearance for enterprises.
Xu Zhiduan, professor at the School of Management of Xiamen University, said that the initial stages of the reform of the business environment was mainly about resolving common problems related to land, labor, capital, technology and data. The next phase will be focused on customization and personalized innovation.
In 2022, Xiamen attracted 172,000 new business entities. The city has been ranked among the top in China in terms of business environment by the National Development and Reform Commission for three consecutive years. Xiamen is currently home to a total of 847,000 registered business entities.
Stimulating market vitality
According to the plan, Xiamen is ramping up efforts to build a competitive and orderly market through key measures such as facilitating access to and exit from the market, taking steps to prevent unfair competition, launching a long-term financing mechanism for small and micro enterprises, improving the joint inspections of matters across departments within the city, and establishing a credit rating classification system.
Xiamen is also striving to build a fair and just legal environment and resolve commercial disputes through innovative mechanisms such as calculating taxes and fees before judicial auctions.
In terms of new fields such as electronic information and artificial intelligence, the city will continue to build a knowledge sharing platform to promote the protection and use of intellectual property rights. Xiamen strictly regulates fair and civilized law enforcement, supports the establishment of a shared debt financing fund for bankruptcy cases, solves the financing problem of shared debts in corporate bankruptcy cases and explores bankruptcy proceedings for small and micro enterprises.
To create an efficient and convenient administrative environment, Xiamen will promote the application and approval of land use and site selection services and carry out a reliability management plan for power, water, gas and internet services.
High-level opening-up
As one of China's first special economic zones, Xiamen will upgrade external circulation and accelerate the city's high-level opening-up, according to the action plan.
Xiamen will take the lead in exploring trade and economic rules centered on digital products, improve data security capabilities and form the ""Xiamen Practice"" to set an example for an open system. The city will launch a trial reform for multi-mode transportation bills of lading, build world-class port facilities, cultivate a pilot zone for offshore trade development and strengthen the innovation of international trade models.
In terms of enhancing internal circulation, Xiamen has applied the latest technologies such as the internet of things and blockchain to boost the innovation and application of the supply chains. The city also plays an active role in constructing the Maritime Silk Road Central Legal District and enhancing the information sharing mechanism for market entities.
Furthermore, Xiamen will further deepen China's dual-circulation development pattern, optimize the institutional mechanisms of domestic and foreign trade, enhance the internationalization level of the financial market and conduct a two-way macro-prudential management of cross-border capital flows.
Innovation in all domains
Under the plan, Xiamen will boost innovation in all aspects based on its regional advantages.
A highland for open innovation, the Xiamen Area of China (Fujian) Pilot Free Trade Zone will focus on building a digital FTZ, a ""single window"" for international trade, a pioneering legal zone for free trade and an agglomeration area for IP services.
The Xiamen Torch Development Zone for High Technology Industries views scientific and technological innovation as the key to its future development, and will pool high-quality innovation resources and optimize the policy system in the region.
Xiamen's six districts will also give full play to their advantages to optimize the business environment: Siming is aiming to become a model for business-friendly environments in Fujian; Huli will build a ""friendly and clear"" business brand; Haicang will create a benchmark for strategic emerging industries in a first-class business environment; Jimei will spearhead the integration of cross-Strait business environments; Tong'an will establish a full-service investment service brand; and Xiang'an is to construct a demonstration area for the reform of relatively concentrated administrative licensing rights.

162;Global Times: Xi kicks off 1st foreign trip since pandemic, ushers in new 'golden' era of ties with Kazakhstan, Business News;;2022-09-15 11:40:00;full;https://www.asiaone.com/business/global-times-xi-kicks-1st-foreign-trip-pandemic-ushers-new-golden-era-ties-kazakhstan;asiaone.com;BEIJING, Sept. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday kicked off his first trip abroad since the COVID-19 pandemic, during which he is scheduled to attend the 22nd meeting…;"BEIJING, Sept. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday kicked off his first trip abroad since the COVID-19 pandemic, during which he is scheduled to attend the 22nd meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and pay state visits to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The first stop took him to Kazakhstan on Wednesday, underscoring that he highly values the bilateral relations with the Central Asian country and indicating such visit will inject new growth momentum for the country, Chinese officials and experts said. Xi first arrived at Nur-sultan on Wednesday afternoon for a state visit to Kazakhstan before landing in Samarkand in the evening to pay a state visit to Uzbekistan and attend the SCO summit. Experts believed that as China's permanent comprehensive strategic partner, Kazakhstan, the Chinese president's first stop in his ongoing foreign trip, is considered as a bridge connecting China with Central Asia and Europe, as it's also where the Chinese president first proposed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and on the first stop of the BRI's westward routes from China, bringing tremendous benefits for the region and the world. Kazakhstan has been striking a balance between China and Russia in terms of political influence, and serving as a bridge for major powers also sets a good example for other Central Asian countries. Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Central Asia are in a very important position in China's overall diplomacy, as all five Central Asian states are China's strategic partners, and among them, China-Kazakhstan partnership has reached one of the highest levels, experts said. When the Chinese president arrived at the Nursultan Nazarbayev International Airport on Wednesday afternoon, he was warmly welcomed by Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, and a group of senior officials including Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Mukhtar Tileuberdi and Nur-Sultan Mayor Altai Kulginov. Xi was later awarded by Tokayev with the ""Order of the Golden Eagle"" — the highest honor to recognize outstanding people who have made significant contributions to Kazakhstan including foreign heads of state promoting Kazakhstan's friendly relations with other countries. During a meeting between Xi and Tokayev, the Chinese top leader said this is his first foreign visit since the COVID-19 pandemic, and choosing Kazakhstan as the first stop demonstrates the high level and uniqueness of China-Kazakhstan ties. Kazakhstan is a major country in Central Asia and Eurasian region with important influence, Xi said, reiterating that the Chinese government attaches great importance to China-Kazakhstan ties and always supports Kazakhstan in maintaining national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. Xi also called on the two countries to promote high-quality Belt and Road development, expand cooperation in such areas as trade, the economy and interconnectivity, and explore cooperation in new fields including big data, digital finance and green energy. Tokayev said that Xi's visit, the Chinese president's first foreign trip since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, fully demonstrated the two countries' high-level mutual trust and will surely become a new milestone in the history of Kazakhstan-China relations. As next year marks the 10th anniversary of Xi's proposing the Belt and Road Initiative in Kazakhstan, Tokayev said his country will continue to support and participate in the joint building of the Belt and Road. After their meeting, the two leaders signed a joint statement commemorating the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. The two governments also signed a number of cooperative documents in areas such as finance and the media, and decided to set up consulates general in Xi'an and Aktobe. A model This year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Kazakhstan. Standing at a new historical starting point of China-Kazakhstan relations, President Xi's visit will surely draw a new blueprint, inject new momentum to the bilateral relations, opening up a new chapter and another golden thirty years of bilateral relations, Zhang Xiao, Chinese Ambassador to Kazakhstan said in a recent interview with media. The bilateral relations have withstood a changing international situation, and the two countries firmly support each other on issues concerning their core interests, making important contribution to the regional and world peace and stability, Zhang noted. In recent years, under the strategic guidance of the two heads of state, the political mutual trust between the two countries has been continuously strengthened, and the two countries will continue to consolidate the political foundation of bilateral relations and create favorable conditions for bilateral cooperation in various fields, he said. Almost a decade ago, Xi visited Kazakhstan, making a significant proposal that China and Central Asian countries build an ""economic belt along the Silk Road"", a trans-Eurasian project spanning from the Pacific Ocean to the Baltic Sea, during a speech at Nazarbayev University in Astana, now known Nur-sultan. He also visited the Central Asian country in 2015 and in 2017 to boost the bilateral ties and regional cooperation through the Belt and Road Initiative. ""President Xi's first visit abroad since the pandemic highlights the importance he attaches to Kazakhstan and Central Asia, which is also seen as a breakthrough in terms of China's foreign exchanges and diplomacy,"" Zhao Huirong, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies, told the Global Times on Wednesday. Central Asia could be seen as China's key ""strategic partner zone"" in the world, she said, as the five Central Asian countries are all China's strategic partners. Among them, Kazakhstan was one of the first to become China's strategic partners, which enjoyed one of the highest-levels of strategic partnership, Zhao said. In a signed article by Xi titled ""Build on the Past to Make Greater Strides in China-Kazakhstan Relations"" published Tuesday on the Kazakhstanskaya Pravda newspaper ahead of his state visit, the Chinese top leader described the two countries as being bound together by mountains and rivers and common interests, which are good neighbors, good friends and good partners. Having stood the test of the changing circumstances and the passage of time, China-Kazakhstan relations have long become rock-solid, Xi said in the article. Setting our sight beyond the pandemic, China would like to partner with Kazakhstan to remain pioneers in Belt and Road cooperation, Xi stressed. China would like to deepen law enforcement, security and defense cooperation with Kazakhstan. Guided by the Global Security Initiative, the two countries should act on the concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and work together to promote the implementation of the Data Security Cooperation Initiative of China+Central Asia, the article said. We should join hands to combat terrorism, separatism, extremism, drug trafficking and transnational organized crimes, and ensure the security of oil and gas pipelines and other large cooperation projects and their personnel. We should resolutely oppose interference by external forces and work together for lasting peace and long-term stability of our region, Xi said. The world has been witnessing more uncertainties now including the uncertainties in supply chain and in foreign relations. China's good neighborhood lays a foundation for the country's prosperity, and as a corridor in Central Asia, Kazakhstan stands at a central stage of China's interaction with the Central Asian countries, Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Wednesday. ""The Central Asian country has been always hoping to serve as a bridge between China and Russia,"" Wang said, noting that striking such balance between major powers also serves as a good example for other Central Asian countries. Belt and Road cooperation is a major highlight in China-Kazakhstan cooperation. In 1992, the bilateral trade volume was only $368 million, but it has reached $25.25 billion in 2021, said Zhang, the Chinese envoy to Kazakhstan. From January to July 2022, China-Kazakhstan trade reached $17.67 billion, up 18.9 percent year-on-year, which is expected to hit a record high for the whole year. The two countries have established a dialogue mechanism for production capacity and investment, and established a special fund for China-Kazakhstan production capacity cooperation, providing strong support for the development of Kazakhstan's energy, industry, transportation and other fields, the Chinese envoy said. Also, among the Central Asian countries, Kazakhstan plays a fundamental role in the trade between China and the Eurasian region, while serving as an important channel for China to link Eurasian countries as the northern line of the China-Europe freight train service. ""China-Europe freight trains pass through Kazakhstan to Europe, and Kazakhstan has gained a lot of benefits from Belt and Road cooperation, which also helped it achieve its long-standing will of serving as a transportation hub in Eurasia,"" Zhao said. Experts said the stability and development of Central Asia is not only the concern of the Central Asian countries, but also the concern of both China and Russia, as the two countries have many consensus and common interests in the region. The current instability in the international and regional situation directly leads to a greater desire for regional stability, peace and development, so there is more demand for closer and more efficient cooperation, Zhao noted. ""As Xi's visit will not only enhance bilateral relations but also boost multilateral cooperation to meet those demand,"" she said. Following the state visit to Kazakhstan, Xi arrived in Samarkand on Wednesday evening to pay a state visit to Uzbekistan and attend the SCO summit, a strategically important occasion of gathering of world leaders such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, according to media reports. While China-Kazakhstan relations serve as an example for China-Central Asia ties, the geopolitical situation in the region has becoming more complex, and experts suggested that China and Central Asian countries should enhance communication and coordination in combating extremist forces. ""To crack down on 'Three Evils', China and Central Asian countries need to enhance security cooperation under the SCO framework including intelligence sharing, staff training, joint exercise in fighting drugs, cross-border organized crimes and preventing the spread of extremist ideas,"" Zhao said.";asiaone.com;4002;business;SG;en;;https://media.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/styles/a1_600x316/public/original_images/Sep2022/pr-newswire_500_4_825.jpg?h=7de12b8a&itok=0yWxWJ-M;False;@asiaonecom;16.054472;d2d0df82da582927826468c22358a83d;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 2}

The major trade fair, with its fifth edition boasting more participating countries, more diverse exhibits and more premium products, also came as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) mega free trade deal began to generate concrete benefits to signatory countries with its trade facilitation measures. Xi said that the CIIE has become a showcase of China's new development paradigm, a platform for high-standard opening-up, and a public good for the whole world. Xi's speech on Friday, which describes opening-up as the key driving force of human civilization, sends a clear message of China's determination to further open to the outside world and also share its development opportunities with the rest of the world, experts noted. China will establish pilot zones for Silk Road e-commerce cooperation and build national demonstration zones for innovative development of trade in services, so as to encourage innovation in trade and promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, Xi said. China will also share the opportunities of institutional opening-up, and actively work to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement and expand a high-standard global free trade network, Xi said in the speech. The keynote speech was concise but highly summarized the spirit of opening-up in the report of the 20th National Congress of the CPC, Li Yong, senior fellow at the China Association of International Trade, told the Global Times on Friday. Sharing development opportunities with developing countries and seeking wider and higher standard trade liberalization via institutional opening-up carries special significance under the current global situation, Li said. Five years after being launched, the CIIE has made new breakthroughs this year. With the addition of Rio Tinto and BHP, the world's top three miners have also gathered together at the CIIE for the first time. With the RCEP deal beginning to exert its positive effects on regional trade, all RCEP member countries have companies hosting exhibits at the fair. A total of 284 Fortune Global 500 firms and major industry players are set to join the business exhibition, up from last year's 281. The attendance by a record number of companies at the CIIE also offered a strong rebuttal to the hype of ""China closing itself up"" made by some Western media outlets and futile efforts by some Western politicians for instigating decoupling with China. The US-China Business Council (USCBC), an advocacy organization representing more than 260 companies that do business in China, told the Global Times that US participation at the 5th CIIE is the same as last year - 200 companies including 32 USCBC members - despite geopolitical turmoil, the volatile COVID-19 situation. New designated exhibition areas were set up for seeds and artificial intelligence, underlining China's determination to improve its agricultural and high-tech sectors. China continues to make strides in high-level opening-up. In October, the country issued 15 measures to facilitate the implementation of foreign-invested projects, with emphasis on the manufacturing sector. China also unveiled a new catalogue of industries to continue incentivizing foreign businesses toward advanced manufacturing, the service sector and the central and western regions. Confidence in hour of need Wei Jianguo, vice chairman of the China Center for International Economic Exchange and former vice minister of the Ministry of Commerce, said the 5th CIIE will bring confidence to the world's farmers, fishers, miners, assembly line workers and multinational companies, as their businesses have been weighed down by global changes and turbulence. The world is being ravaged by the pandemic, the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and soaring energy prices. For instance, as much as 17 percent of factories in Germany are slashing production, according to media reports.  In its latest world economic outlook, the IMF downgraded global growth to a meagre 2.7 percent for 2023, down from the 2.9 percent it projected in July. ""Under such circumstances, the 5th CIIE sends a signal to the world that the Chinese production and consumption market is rapidly warming up, thereby greatly boosting the confidence of the world's business circle,"" said Wei. As China continues to grow, its appetite for agricultural goods, energy products and mineral goods continues to grow, and this will be a reassuring message to global companies at this hour of need, Wei said, describing China's pouring of the whole country's resources into one import trade fair as part of commitments in its efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind. On Friday, Chinese oil giant Sinopec signed energy purchase deals worth $40.1 billion and imports from the North American region jumped 86 percent from the last CIIE, with Canadian companies appearing on the list of suppliers for the first time. Amazing five years Over the past four years, the CIIE has seen the value of accumulated deals reaching $272.27 billion, with procurement orders by Chinese buyers proving to be of great value to global companies, which have flocked to the event. Over 1,500 new products, technologies and services made their debut at the previous four shows. More and more global companies and investors have come to regard the CIIE as the place to connect with China for further opportunities to go deeper and enjoy the fruits of China's economic development. ""As China's most significant import exhibition, the CIIE very much facilitated international companies like Bayer, to share and grow together with China's economic development,"" Werner Baumann, CEO of German drug maker Bayer AG told the Global Times. Since the first CIIE in 2018, the Chinese market has gradually grown to become the most important one for Dole in Asia, Wang Na, brand director of Dole China, told the Global Times on Friday. Wang said the company is committed to bringing more of the world's fruits to Chinese consumers' dinner tables. ""The CIIE gives us a deeper understanding of the vitality and potential of the Chinese market, and makes us more confident, more determined, and more ambitious to thrive in this major world market,"" Zhang Heping, head of Sanofi Vaccines China told the Global Times. ""Over the course of five years, the Sri Lanka pavilion has grown from just having Ceylon tea exhibitors to including food and jewelry pavilions and dozens of categories of products. I have felt the changes and growth that the CIIE has brought to Sri Lankan exhibitors,"" Chiranjaya Udumullage, president of the China Sri Lanka Association for Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times. Given the broader participation this year, and the palpable sense of optimism by attendants, Wei predicted the volume of deals reached will be larger than at the 4th CIIE.";asiaone.com;4002;business;SG;en;;https://media.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/styles/a1_600x316/public/original_images/Nov2022/pr-newswire_500_4_416.jpg?h=7de12b8a&itok=3tyQlbdz;False;@asiaonecom;15.38607;fa0d3423da714915343e17befa9423d3;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 2}

Over the past three decades, the zone has grown from a test field of less than 1 square kilometer to the current nine sub-areas across the city. Its annual industrial output also increased from 146 million yuan ($22.92 million) to more than 300 billion yuan. Described as a ""special zone within a special zone,"" it has made outstanding achievements in the city. While possessing less than 3 percent of the total land in Xiamen, it has contributed to 43 percent of the city's industrial output, about 70 percent of the revenue of the city's software and information service industry, as well as nearly half of the city's industrial fixed-asset investment. What's the secret of the zone's amazing growth? Intensive high-end industrial clusters In 1992, Swiss conglomerate ABB Group set up its first operation in the Xiamen Torch High-tech Zone. Since then, eight ABB subsidiaries, as well as two ABB research and development technology centers have settled in the zone. The ABB Xiamen Hub located in Torch (Xiang'an) Industrial Zone has become the group's largest innovation and manufacturing center in the world, supplying products to more than 60 countries and regions. Another example is Taiwan LCD panel maker AU Optronics, which opened a plant in the zone in 2006 and brought in a group of related companies, helping form Xiamen's first 100-billion-yuan industrial chain of panel displays. A series of successful cases have resulted from the zone's efforts to develop pillar industries and enhance their competitiveness. ""The high-tech zone, which has served as a major hub for Xiamen's high-end manufacturing, software, and information industries, has given top priority to attracting investment and expanding industrial chains,"" said Zhuang Rongliang, director of the zone's administrative commission, in an interview with Xiamen Daily. ""We have been working to fulfill our duty as 'gardeners' who create fertile ground for business, selecting high-quality 'seedlings' and offering abundant 'nutrients' to help companies grow into industrial giants,"" Zhuang added. The zone also founded a venture capital fund worth 3 billion yuan in 2020 and brought in three sub-funds within half a year, increasing the total amount to 9.02 billion yuan. In recent years, the zone has focused on new-generation information technology, artificial intelligence, big data, internet of things, new materials, new energy, and digital cultural creativity, aiming to become a hotbed of these emerging industries. Sound environment with innovative talent The high-tech zone launched two service platforms for financing and smart manufacturing in October 2020 to help companies promote technical reform, as well as to enhance the efficiency of financing, while reduce costs. ""Thanks to the zone's service platform, companies can learn about preferential policies and choose financial products in a quick manner that's like shopping in a supermarket,"" said Jiang Wei, manager of the finance department of Xiamen Lenz Communication Co, which was recently granted 10 million yuan in credit by Xiamen Bank. Over the years, the zone has been working to provide targeted services to companies in aspects like personnel, capital, and land, aiming to create a sound environment for innovative development. By 2020, the zone had been home to more than 10,000 businesses, topping all development zones in Fujian province. About 200,000 people are currently working in the zone, including more than 1,500 who are included in talent programs at the municipal level and above. Xiamen Torch University, a new talent enhancement initiative of the zone, was established on May 9, aiming to promote innovation and industrial upgrading by closely combining education and research with the actual needs of companies located in the zone. The university has the potential to not only lift the industrial capability of Xiamen, but spur economic development in other parts of China and even other BRICS economies, said Leslie Maasdorp, vice-president of the Shanghai-based New Development Bank, on the sidelines of the establishment ceremony of Xiamen Torch University. He said that its experience in nurturing talent and promoting innovation could provide strategies that can be replicated elsewhere, while training materials used here can be shared with other regions in a virtual format. While celebrating its milestone 30th anniversary, the high-tech zone has set goals for its future development. It aims to become a first-class sci-tech zone with clout in the Asia-Pacific region and a demonstration area for cooperation between BRICS countries in emerging industries by 2035. It is also expected to build world-class industrial chains in the electronic information industry, as well as become a major platform for exchanges between countries and regions along the Maritime Silk Road. night scene";asiaone.com;4002;business;SG;en;[];https://mma.prnasia.com/media2/1522382/sunrise_scenery.jpg?p=medium600;False;@asiaonecom;15.103633;e8da38482bfc0b2b86c6f0dc9230fc25;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 2}

Dr. Wilfred Wong, president of Sands China Ltd., speaks at The Venetian Macao Thursday for the opening ceremony of Project Sands X: Beyond the Blue – An Exhibition of Ceramic Extraordinaire. A special exhibition of Art Macao: Macao International Art Biennale 2021, Beyond the Blue is open to the public 10 a.m.-10 p.m. daily July 15-Oct. 31. Guests of honour officiate a ribbon cutting at The Venetian Macao Thursday during the opening ceremony for Project Sands X: Beyond the Blue – An Exhibition of Ceramic Extraordinaire. Sands China's striking ceramics exhibition for Art Macao, Project Sands X: Beyond the Blue – An Exhibition of Ceramic Extraordinaire, is now open for public viewing at The Venetian Macao. Ceramic curator and artist Caroline Cheng leads guests of honour on a guided tour of Project Sands X: Beyond the Blue – An Exhibition of Ceramic Extraordinaire after the exhibition's opening ceremony Thursday at The Venetian Macao. Project Sands X: Beyond the Blue – An Exhibition of Ceramic Extraordinaire, is one of the special exhibitions of Art Macao: Macao International Art Biennale 2021 and is open to the public 10 a.m.-10 p.m. daily July 15-Oct. 31. Sands China invited internationally famed artist Caroline Cheng to curate the exhibition, who called on the talents of more than 20 world-renowned ceramic artists and institutions to create works on the theme of Beyond the Blue. The result is an eye-catching display of both traditional and innovative creations. The Beyond the Blue theme is faceted in meaning. The works utilise a diversity of designs and palettes, showcasing how the beauty of ceramics can go beyond the traditional colours of blue and white. By applying innovative techniques, technologies and designs, the artists have created pieces that go beyond all expectations and imagination, in hopes of bringing positivity to the world through art. Through this exceptional collection of works, the exhibition seeks to elicit joy and inspire visitors to go beyond the blue mood of a pandemic world with optimism for a brighter future ahead. ""Sands China is thrilled to have Caroline Cheng back to once again curate a truly extraordinary ceramic exhibition for Art Macao,"" said President of Sands China Ltd. Dr. Wilfred Wong. ""In response to Art Macao's event theme, 'To create for well-being', we believe our Project Sands X: Beyond the Blue exhibition will delight and surprise visitors as they discover that ceramics can go far beyond their expectations. It is our pleasure to support Art Macao with this collection of imaginative and innovative ceramic artwork. It is without exaggeration a must-see exhibition that has to be seen in person to fully experience the wonder of these remarkable creations. Our thanks go to the Macao government for their patronage and organisation of Art Macao and for their support, to the artists for their inventive works, and to Ms. Cheng and our team members for their tireless work on this exhibition."" In 2019, Sands China presented a gold-themed ceramics exhibition for the inaugural Art Macao, in consideration of Macao's centuries-long history as a key port for porcelain export on the Maritime Silk Road. After the success of the very popular All That's Gold Does Glitter – An Exhibition of Glamorous Ceramics, Sands China is now unveiling an even greater variety of ceramic masterworks with Beyond the Blue. These exciting new works created on a new theme will once again surprise viewers and expand their appreciation of this multi-faceted art form. Cheng, the curator of both exhibitions, said: ""The internet and digital technology have transformed our lives. This exhibition shows how an ancient art like making ceramics can take advantage of techniques unavailable to artisans of the past to now make ingenious creations previously thought impossible. And with modern-day technologies like augmented reality and livestreaming, viewers can interact with and enjoy art in an entirely new way and connect with each other in real time regardless of geographical distance. We hope that, with Beyond the Blue, this interconnectedness and creativity inspires us all with hope and determination for a safe and unified post-pandemic world."" Beyond the Blue's works combine technology and ceramics with innovative presentation, and visitors are able to interact with selected pieces via a free augmented reality (AR) smartphone app. Exhibition attendees can create their own virtual artwork or digitally insert exhibition elements into their selfies. Exhibits made from recycled ceramics promoting sustainability in art are also on display with a vision to create a better world. To enhance their enjoyment and understanding of the exhibits, visitors can listen to a complimentary audio guide on their smartphones to learn about the artists and their works while browsing the exhibition. One particularly interesting and unusual aspect of the exhibition is a unique parallel exhibition of Beyond the Blue with the Everson Museum of Art, which contains one of the United States' foremost collections of ceramic art. As a way to build on themes of interactivity and celebration, the Everson has created a real-time exhibition in the museum that can be viewed in 3D by remote visitors on their smartphones and at an interactive screen at The Venetian Macao main lobby. Viewers are able to manoeuvre through the 360-degree space, while translated text and audio-video hyperlinks provide more information in English and Chinese. Meanwhile, Beyond the Blue also features 14 signature works from the Everson at The Venetian Macao. In this way, the exhibition is able to make use of technology to connect people across international borders, virtually transporting Beyond the Blue visitors to the Everson, while also bringing works from the Everson to Macao. Another element of Sands China's support to Art Macao is the Time Is On My Side – 2021 Greater Bay Area Young Artists Scheme – A Competition of Painting & Photography. The July-October contest was announced at Thursday's opening ceremony, which also marks the opening of artwork recruitment for the competition. One of the judges, Dr. Wang Lan, gave an introductory speech and talked about the judging criteria for the contest, which is open to young artists from Macao and the Greater Bay Area. Winners receive cash prizes and certificates to encourage them to continue their art, and their works will be displayed at The Londoner® Macao. More information is available at https://en.sandsresortsmacao.com/art-competition.html.

 /PRNewswire/ --  
On 
April 25
,
 2023, World Health Organization (WHO) gave as the theme for World Malaria Day 2023
 
Time to deliver zero malaria: invest, innovate, implement
. Within this theme, WHO will mainly focus on the third ""i"" – implement – and notably the critical importance of reaching hard to reach populations with the tools and strategies that are available today.
 
This year 2023 also marks the 10
th
 anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative. Medicine knows no borders. Artemisinin and its derivatives have moved from the countries along the Belt and Road to the forefront of the world's battle against malaria since it was discovered by Chinese scientists, more than 50 years ago. Through continuous innovation and global operation, Fosun Pharma has implemented and extended its efforts to  ""Helping Africa Fight Malaria"" and contributed to the implementation of the ""Belt and Road Initiative"" building  a community with a shared positive future for mankind. By the end of 2022, Artesun (Artesunate for Injection), independently developed and manufactured by Fosun Pharma, had treated over 56 million patients with severe malaria worldwide, becoming a prime example for innovative medicinal products developed in 
China
 serving  the world.
 
 
World Malaria Day 2023, together we build a Malaria-free world
 
 
Chinese wisdom and solutions contribute to the global anti-malarial fight and to build a better future through the ""Belt and Road Initiative""
 
As one of the oldest and most widely spreading infectious diseases in the world, malaria continues to have a devastating impact on human health around the world. Historically, malaria was also widespread in 
China
. In the 1970s, a profound effort by researchers in 
China
 as a potent antimalarial drug,  inspired by ancient traditional Chinese medicine books. Subsequent development, clinical trials and deployment of this new class of drugs was essential for, malaria prevention and control in 
China
, accumulating after more than 70 years of unremitting efforts, certification by the WHO of  ""Malaria-free"" in 2021. From 30 million cases of the disease annually to zero, 
China's
 tireless effort to achieve this important milestone in the fight against malaria demonstrates the persistence, efforts and dedication of the Chinese people of several generations of Chinese people.
 
However, the global efforts to control and eliminate malaria remain challenging: whereas some countries have importantly reduced their malaria burden or even eliminated malaria; others countries have seen an increase in the number of malaria patients. There were an estimated 619,000 deaths due to malaria in 2021 according to the 
World Malaria Report 2022
 released in 
December 2022
. The WHO African Region carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. In 2021, the Region was home to 95% of malaria cases (234 million) and 96% of malaria deaths (593,000). Children under five years old accounted for about 80% of all malaria deaths in the Region.
 
To truly win the fight against malaria, malaria must be eradicated globally!
 
Over the past decade of the Belt and Road Initiative, 
China's
 products for malaria prevention and control, as well as 
China's
 approach to malaria elimination, have been closely observed and are widely recognized by the WHO and the international malaria community. 
China's
 experience continues to contribute to malaria control and elimination in developing countries. The story of 
China's
 participation in global malaria elimination extends the purpose of the Silk Road and it aims to create a better future through the ""Belt and Road Initiative"". From the discovery of artemisinin by 
Tu Youyou
 to the wide application of artesunate for injection, an innovative drug developed in 
China
, Chinese wisdom, and approaches contribute to the global fight against malaria.
 
Fosun Pharma continues its independent R&D of innovative antimalarial drugs used for malaria prevention, treatment of uncomplicated malaria and life-saving treatment of severe malaria patients
 
In 1987, Guilin Pharma, a Fosun Pharma subsidiary, was authorized the China No. X-01 Class I New Drug Certificate by the Ministry of Health of the PRC for its independently researched and developed artesunate, and the No. X-02 New Drug Certificate for artesunate for injection. Since then, artesunate has been widely used for the treatment of malaria globally, saving countless lives of malaria patients. In 2000, it was listed as one of the essential antimalarial drugs  by the World Health Organization. In early 2011, the World Health Organization revised the 
Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria
 by changing the first-line drug for treating severe malaria from quinine to injectable artesunate. By the end of 2022, Fosun Pharma had supplied more than 280 million doses of Artesun (artesunate for injection) to the world, treating more than 56 million severe malaria patients worldwide.
 
Fosun Pharma continues its independent R&D of innovative antimalarial drugs used for malaria prevention, malaria treatment and life-saving treatment of severe malaria patients. Ranging from malaria treatment to prevention, Fosun Pharma continues to provide solutions, in particular also for children, helping to effectively reduce the malaria burden and death toll of malaria in children under five years old in 
Africa
.
 
In 
August 2018
, Fosun Pharma's SPAQ-CO® Disp (co-packed sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine dispersible tablets and amodiaquine dispersible tablets), for the prevention of malaria in children, was pre-qualified by WHO (WHO-PQ). By the end of 2022, around 210 million children in 
Africa
 have benefited from the ""Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention Program"", for which SPAQ-CO® Disp is used as the core drug and which has effectively reduced the morbidity of malaria in children under five years old in 
Africa
.
 
Continuously improve global operation capability and fulfill corporate social responsibility
 
Since 2006, Fosun Pharma has actively participated in the Chinese government's Assistance to 
Africa
 in Fighting Malaria and has also participated in various public welfare activities and international malaria research projects aiming to help improve malaria control capacity in 
Africa
. Fosun Pharma has been a core supplier of antimalarial drugs to the Global Fund, UNICEF, WHO, and national drug procurement centers in 
Africa
.
 
In recent years, Fosun Pharma has continuously improved its global operating capacity. By the end of 2022, a revenue of 
RMB 13.938 billion
 was earned in regions outside Chinese Mainland and other countries, accounting for 31.7% of its total revenue 2022.
 
After more than 15 years of operations in 
Africa
, Fosun Pharma has established a sales and marketing network in 39 countries and regions in 
Africa
, ensuring the continued availability of medicines and healthcare products in 
Africa
, including antimalarial drugs. Moreover, Fosun Pharma has set up five regional distribution centers in emerging markets such as 
Africa
, with a first-line commercialization team of approximately 800 people. Among them, the Côte d'Ivoire distribution center in 
West Africa
 was officially opened in 2021 and is currently the largest local drug distribution center in the francophone region of 
West Africa
.
 
In 
November 2022
, Fosun Pharma's Côte d'Ivoire campus project was officially launched, marking an important step for Fosun Pharma in the realization of local drug manufacturing and supply in 
Africa
. In the future, the antimalarials and antibiotics produced by Fosun Pharma's Côte d'Ivoire factory will be distributed through its holding subsidiary Tridem Pharma to help Côte d'Ivoire and other regions in 
West Africa
 realize the local supply of essential drugs, thus reducing the risk of drug shortage, important for instance in case of public health crises requiring an emergency response.
 
 
Fosun Pharma's Côte d'Ivoire park project was launched to promote localized drug manufacturing and supply in Africa
 
 
Wen Deyong
, CEO of Fosun Pharma
, said, ""As a global innovation-driven pharmaceutical and healthcare industry group, Fosun Pharma always regards innovation as the most important social responsibility for a pharmaceutical enterprise. Up to now, Fosun Pharma has 30 antimalarial drugs prequalified by WHO, ranking first in the world. Meanwhile, Fosun Pharma's global operational networks will further improve the availability and affordability of antimalarial medicines so as to contribute to the achievement of the goal to end malaria by 2030.""

J Hotel Shanghai…;"SHANGHAI, June 19, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- J Hotel has debuted its inaugural property today atop the Shanghai Tower, the tallest skyscraper in China and second-tallest in the world. J Hotel Shanghai Tower has reached a new milestone of success among China's homegrown hotels as it occupies the highest point in Shanghai. Jin Jiang International Hotels, China's largest and the world's second-largest hotel group, debuts the premiere luxury hospitality brand after dedicating ten years into its detailed curation, masterful craft, and opulent design. J Hotel weaves together broad influences from different realms of art and culture to bring a unique luxury perspective to Shanghai. It merges artistic touches throughout its design for palatial staterooms and the best in lifestyle, wellbeing, food & beverage, technology, and hospitality services, presenting an exclusive travel experience crafted with authentic Chinese flair. J Hotel Shanghai Tower Exterior A Shanghai View Above It All J Hotel Shanghai Tower is located at the top of the 632-meter Shanghai Tower in the heart of Lujiazui, offering a bird's-eye view across the whole expanse of Shanghai. From this unparalleled location, guests can savor a view above and beyond all else. The horizon stretches clear from Hongqiao Airport in the west to the Yangtze River's powerful entrance into the East China Sea. It also provides a rare perspective on the nearby Oriental Pearl Tower and the Bund, offering a chance to contemplate the city's rich historical evolution. J Hotel Shanghai Tower also carries forward the brand's ambitious ideals, delivering its own interpretation of home and the world as they intersect with Chinese culture. By crafting luxury hotels that combine modern aesthetics and Chinese tradition, the J brand aims to set the benchmark for China's homegrown hospitality industry. The Art of Interior Design The interior design of J Hotel Shanghai Tower was led by Lv Haiyan, Chairman of Jin Jiang Luxury Hotels Management Co., Ltd, renowned novelist and award-winning screenwriter and crafted by R&O, a respected studio dedicated to the world's top hotels that was founded by Oscar LLinas and the late Robert Bilkey. Both Bilkey and LLinas personally participated in the hotel's design, which is Bilkey's final masterpiece on his life-long journey of designing wonders. Guests are welcomed into the vast interior with six crystal Roman columns leading to an eight-meter-high Shikumen – the stately courtyard gates traditional to Shanghai – in an astonishing design that seamlessly blends the best of the east and west. On the sprawling tower's Floor 101, a sky bridge of laminated glass and metal unfolds before guests. At the end of the bridge, guests are met with graceful ballerinas dancing across the sky in delicately threaded metallics as an installation handcrafted by French artist Pauline Ohrel to invite every visitor into a unique universe of art and culture. At this artistic landmark in the clouds, designers have utilized lacquer, glaze and enamel works as well as metal, crystal and mosaics that give life to a breathtaking space with creativity at every turn. The hotel also invited Chinese and international artists to collaborate on artworks that reflect their individual style while connecting in a cohesive design language, inviting guests to explore the carefully curated art exhibition that spans different floors. The Art of an Elegant Residence J Hotel Shanghai Tower boasts 165 rooms, including 34 suites. The staterooms and suites are located from Floors 86 to 98 and vary from 62 square meters to 380 square meters, making them some of the highest and most spacious options in Shanghai. Nestled into the Shanghai Tower's spiral, every stateroom has unique views. Beginning at the Huangpu River and cutting through the heart of the city below, guests have access to Shanghai's diverse and spectacular urban scenery, from the Bund and the Oriental Pearl Tower to the expanses across Puxi and Pudong. As guests walk along the breathtaking guestroom corridors lined with unique art pieces lit by Chinese carved ""lui li"" crystal frames, they will discover doors of different colors. Behind each colored door lies the intrigue and unrivaled luxury of different guestroom design styles at J Hotel: New Chinese and Contemporary. In the New Chinese staterooms, bespoke embossed wallpaper recalls the Yangtze Delta's ancient pavilions and buildings, giving a sense of the region's historic prosperity and elegance. The leather-trimmed TV cabinet and emerald glazed tea table embody dignified traditional Chinese culture. From the gold trim on the olive-green calfskin wall panel and dragon patterns on the sofa to the hand-blown glass floral bedside decorations and Tang Sancai-style ornaments, this thoughtfully crafted interior melds a touch of opulence with a rejuvenating environment. The bathroom is made of white marble with an exquisite glazed backdrop inlaid with a magnolia pattern in full bloom. A full set of Italian-made crystal faucets engraved with the J logo also reflects Jinjiang's determination to build a homegrown high-end brand. The Contemporary staterooms are boldly constructed, defined by crystal magnolias and laminated glass. Sumptuous natural calfskin wall panels add elegance and spaciousness to the sanctuary. The bedside canopy woven with gold and silver wire, crystal magnolia lamps and a two-meter-wide Italian crystal glass TV cabinet all demonstrate exquisite craftsmanship. Selected furniture and ornaments reflect the sophistication of our guests, who can relax in the magnolia petal-shaped bathtub by the window and take in the breathtaking views across the Huangpu River. All prevailing staterooms incorporate separated spaces including a bedroom, living area, bathroom and walk-in closet, creating personal sanctuaries in different layouts and styles. The mini-bar at the entrance offers various drinks and snacks, as well as a Nespresso™ coffee machine and a Chinese tea set.

Whether it be with the integrated crystal executive desk in the New China stateroom or the natural leather executive desk in the Contemporary stateroom, both room styles offer an intuitive workspace, along with high-speed Internet access, USB and HDMI ports and audio inputs. Each room's built-in Smart Senor Control System allows digital control of the TV, curtains, air conditioning and lights, as well as personal butler services, all with a simple tap on a tablet. The complementary 10 M Internet access not only meets guests' needs for high-speed connectivity, but also allows them to enjoy remote document printing services.

Guests are greeted by a luxurious Chinese phoenix and peony embroidery on the calfskin wall at the entrance, before being led into the curved parlor that boasts an exclusive panoramic view of Shanghai. Enriched with elegant furniture and cutting-edge artwork, the Shanghai Suite perfectly illustrates the art of luxury living above it all.

Patrick Semansky, Reuters/Pool

CARBIS BAY, England - The Group of Seven richest democracies sought on Saturday to counter China's growing influence by offering developing nations an infrastructure plan that could rival President Xi Jinping's multi-trillion-dollar Belt and Road initiative.

The G7, whose leaders are meeting in southwestern England, has been searching for a coherent response to the growing assertiveness of Xi after China's surging economic and military rise over the past 40 years.

U.S. President Joe Biden and other G7 leaders hope their plan, known as the Build Back Better World (B3W) initiative, will provide a transparent infrastructure partnership to help narrow the $40 trillion needed by developing nations by 2035, the White House said.

""This is not just about confronting or taking on China,"" a senior official in Biden's administration said. ""But until now we haven't offered a positive alternative that reflects our values, our standards and our way of doing business.""

The United States later said there was a G7 consensus on the need for a shared approach to China on trade and human rights.

The G7 and its allies will use the B3W initiative to mobilise private-sector capital in areas such as climate, health and health security, digital technology, and gender equity and equality, the White House added.

It was not immediately clear how exactly the plan would work or how much capital it would ultimately allocate.

China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) scheme, which Xi launched in 2013, involves development and investment initiatives that would stretch from Asia to Europe and beyond.

More than 100 countries have signed agreements with China to cooperate in BRI projects like railways, ports, highways and other infrastructure.

Critics say Xi's plan to create a modern version of the ancient Silk Road trade route to link China with Asia, Europe and beyond is a vehicle for the expansion of Communist China. Beijing says such doubts betray the ""imperial hangover"" of many Western powers that humiliated China for centuries.

CHINA'S RISE

Leaders of the G7 - the United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, Italy, France and Japan - want to use their gathering in the seaside resort of Carbis Bay to show the world that the richest democracies can offer an alternative to China's growing clout.

The re-emergence of China as a leading global power is considered to be one of the most significant geopolitical events of recent times, alongside the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union that ended the Cold War.

China in 1979 had an economy that was smaller than Italy's, but after opening to foreign investment and introducing market reforms, it has become the world's second-largest economy and is a global leader in a range of new technologies.

The U.S. official said until now, the West had failed to offer a positive alternative to the ""lack of transparency, poor environmental and labor standards, and coercive approach"" of the Chinese government that had left many countries worse off.

According to a Refinitiv database, as of mid-last year, more than 2,600 projects at a cost of $3.7 trillion were linked to the BRI, although the Chinese foreign ministry said last June that about 20% of projects had been seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

As part of the G7 plan, the United States will work with the U.S. Congress to supplement existing development financing and to ""collectively catalyze hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investment"", the White House said.

CRITICISM OVER CAMPS

Biden made ""forceful comments"" to G7 leaders about the need to make a strong statement on Washington and rights group say is the use of forced labor in China, but there was a ""spectrum of how far different countries are willing to go"" in their criticism in a final communique from the three-day summit, another U.S. official said.

The U.S. official later said the G7 had reached consensus on the need for a shared approach on ""non-market economic practices"" and on human rights abuses, and to coordinate on supply-chain resilience.

The United States has pushed for specific language in the communique about alleged forced labor in the China's Xinjiang region, officials said.

U.N. experts and rights groups estimate over a million people, mainly Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, have been detained in recent years in a vast system of camps in Xinjiang.

China denies all accusations of forced labor or abuse. It initially denied the camps existed, but has since said they are vocational centers and are designed to combat extremism. In late 2019, China said all people in the camps had ""graduated"".

The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.";abs-cbn.com;4178;politics;PH;en;['Steve Holland', 'Guy Faulconbridge'];https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/2021/overseas/06/12/20210611-g7-leaders-rtr.jpg;False;@ABSCBNNews;17.632792;6b3d79e22cf0375b3416a9bab5a03853;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 2}

China has demonstrated its commitment to opening up wider and sharing growth opportunity with the global community by hosting the event as scheduled this year amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Themed ""Towards Digital Future and Service Driven Development,"" this year's fair, held both online and offline from Sept. 2 to 7, features opening-up and cooperation across the board, providing an important platform for global market players to showcase their latest services. With wider reach, the trade fair has attracted more than 10,000 enterprises from 153 countries and regions, five more countries compared to last year's event, with more Fortune 500 companies involved. The magnet effect, in fact, is due to China's huge market and improved business environment. China has been the world's second-largest country in services trade for seven years, building services trade relations with nearly 240 countries and regions. China has taken a raft of measures to deepen opening-up of its service sector, such as shortening the negative list for foreign investment for four consecutive years and making opening-up commitments in 22 more service fields. China will open up at a higher level by implementing nationwide a negative list for cross-border services trade, upgrading the digital trade pilot zones to demonstration zones, deepening the reform of the New Third Board (National Equities Exchange and Quotations) and setting up Beijing Stock Exchange. Using peace, development and win-win cooperation as the ""golden key"", China will work with other countries to boost the services trade as well as the world economy.

Since the mining ban came to China, there has been a massive migration of Bitcoin hash rate to the United States. There have been many narratives and pushes from pro-American Bitcoiners to continue attracting more hash rate to the U.S., including pushing to create favorable regulatory environments for miners here in North America.

Humans are innately social creatures. We enjoy meals together, we exchange ideas with one another, and when the time is right, we set our soul free and surrender to the flow of living in the moment with like-minded beings. We are, after all, just swimming in this real thing we call life. As technology progresses with exponential rapidity, the methods we use to communicate and share information are going through a dramatic shift. Our trip may be short but we have come a long way in just a few decades of technological innovations. These innovations are paving the way for a new frontier of connecting with our fellow humans: new ways of exchanging ideas, storing information and transmitting value are shattering the legacy systems that have for far too long been the status quo. If we can imagine it, we can build it — and if we can build it right we have the ability to conjure up a world that values truth, fairness and a chance at an equitable future for all.

United States (US) President Joe Biden and other G7 leaders relaunched the newly renamed ""Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment,"" at their annual gathering being held this year at Schloss Elmau in southern Germany. Mr Biden said the United States would mobilize US$200 billion in grants, federal funds and private investment over five years to support projects in low- and middle-income countries that help tackle climate change as well as improve global health, gender equity and digital infrastructure. ""I want to be clear. This isn't aid or charity. It's an investment that will deliver returns for everyone,"" Mr Biden said, adding that it would allow countries to ""see the concrete benefits of partnering with democracies."" Mr Biden said hundreds of billions of additional dollars could come from multilateral development banks, development finance institutions, sovereign wealth funds and others. Europe will mobilize 300 billion euros for the initiative over the same period to build up a sustainable alternative to China's Belt and Road Initiative scheme, which Chinese President Xi Jinping launched in 2013, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the gathering. The leaders of Italy, Canada and Japan also spoke about their plans, some of which have already been announced separately. French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson were not present, but their countries are also participating. China's investment scheme involves development and programs in over 100 countries aimed at creating a modern version of the ancient Silk Road trade route from Asia to Europe. White House officials said the plan has provided little tangible benefit for many developing countries. Mr Biden highlighted several flagship projects, including a US$2 billion solar development project in Angola with support from the Commerce Department, the U.S. Export-Import Bank, US firm AfricaGlobal Schaffer, and US project developer Sun Africa. Together with G7 members and the EU, Washington will also provide US$3.3 million in technical assistance to Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal as it develops an industrial-scale flexible multi-vaccine manufacturing facility in that country that can eventually produce Covid-19 and other vaccines, a project that also involves the EU. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) will also commit up to US$50 million over five years to the World Bank's global Childcare Incentive Fund. Ms Friederike Roder, vice president of the non-profit group Global Citizen, said the pledges of investment could be ""a good start"" toward greater engagement by G7 countries in developing nations and could underpin stronger global growth for all. G7 countries on average provide only 0.32 per cent of their gross national income, less than half of the 0.7 per cent promised, in development assistance, she said. ""But without developing countries, there will be no sustainable recovery of the world economy,"" she said.

 SEPANG, Nov 1 — China is optimistic its trade and investment with Malaysia will scale new heights in the post-pandemic era, said Chinese Ambassador to Malaysia Ouyang Yujing. In light of the 12th Malaysia Plan, China is willing to work together with Malaysia to strengthen trade and investment cooperation, tap into the potential for cooperation in emerging fields, and promote the economic integration of China-Malaysia towards common developments for both countries, he said. Potential areas of cooperation include the digital economy, electrical and electronics industry, high-tech and cyber security, he said. 'As an important node of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, Malaysia enjoys a strategic location and a sound business environment. 'We are willing to share experience in opening up and development with Malaysia, continue to deepen practical cooperation and strategic synergising and cooperation planning, so as to promote the economic recovery and social development in the post-pandemic era.
'We are supposed to turn the crisis into an opportunity, which will bring our cooperation to a higher level and yield valuable and remarkable results,' he said at the launch of the Cainiao Aeropolis electronic World Trade Platform (eWTP) Hub here today.
Ouyang said the bilateral trade volume between China and Malaysia and China's non-financial investment to Malaysia increased against the odds by 43.9 per cent and 76.3 per cent, respectively, in the first half of this year.
China has also remained Malaysia's largest trading partner for 12 consecutive years, as well as the largest foreign direct investment source in Malaysia's manufacturing sector for five consecutive years, he said.
'Our two countries have always been focusing on deepening collaborations encompassing various areas including industrial parks, infrastructure construction, equipment manufacturing, ICT (information and communications technology) and digital economy.
'The signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership injected new impetus into the economic development of the Asia-Pacific region, which will also bear new fields, new models and new business formats for our pragmatic cooperation. 'It will also play a prominent role in promoting economic recovery and long-term prosperity,' he said.
Ouyang said China and Malaysia would further enhance cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative framework, deepen synergy between development strategies, foster new growth drivers and create new highlights in cooperation.
Both countries would also leverage the advantages for further upgrading their bilateral economic cooperation, he added.
China and Malaysia have had bilateral relations over the past 47 years, with deepening mutual political trust, steady progress in economic cooperation, as well as increasingly close people-to-people exchanges and friendships. — Bernama";malaymail.com;5981;finance;MY;en;[];https://media2.malaymail.com/resize_cache/uploads/articles/2020/2020-04/malaysia-china-reuters_20200403-seo.jpg;False;@malaymail;20.762304;7d5278fb865e4ce9d747276cc8087a18;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 2}

Notably absent will be French President Emmanual Macron who had formally joined the Chinese infrastructure programme.'The president's not thinking that we need to spend dollar for dollar versus China... though if you add up what the US and the G7 partners are going to be announcing, it comes pretty close to the number,' one senior US official told reporters.The funds would be raised through grants and federal funds, and by leveraging private-sector investments, the White House said, adding that hundreds of billions of additional dollars could come from multilateral development banks, development finance institutions, sovereign wealth funds and others.China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) scheme, which Chinese President Xi Jinping launched in 2013, involves development and investment initiatives in over 100 countries, with a range of projects including railways, ports and highways.White House officials say Xi's plan to create a modern version of the ancient Silk Road trade route has provided little tangible benefit for many developing countries, with top jobs going to Chinese workers, while increasing rates of forced and child labor.Biden will highlight several flagship projects, including a US$2 billion solar development project in Angola with support from the Commerce Department, the US Export-Import Bank, US firm AfricaGlobal Schaffer, and US project developer Sun Africa.Together with G7 members and the EU, Washington will also provide US$3.3 million in technical assistance to Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal as it develops an industrial-scale flexible multi-vaccine manufacturing facility in that country that can eventually produce Covid-19 and other vaccines.The US Agency for International Development (USAID) will also commit up to US$50 million over five years to the World Bank's new global Childcare Incentive Fund, a project aimed at address the gap in suitable childcare infrastructure. — Reuters;malaymail.com;5981;finance;MY;en;;https://www.malaymail.com/malaymail/uploads/images/2022/06/26/27788.JPG?v=1656280680;False;;19.158207;091476039b1801c0a48e37920cfd7866;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 2}
197;China's persecution of Uyghurs is preview of wider surveillance scheme, lawmakers say;Roseanne Gerin;2021-11-18 00:30:32;full;https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/commission-hearing-11172021191538.html;rfa.org;Author tells panel what's happened in Xinjiang amounts to ‘mass psychological torture.';"Members of a bipartisan congressional commission warned Wednesday that China's use of technology to repress Muslim Uyghurs in its far-western Xinjiang is widening and could be exported around the world.
The U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which Congress established in 2000, held a hearing in Washington to draw attention to human rights abuses and the strategic impact of mass surveillance technology and censorship used by China, including in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
Sen. Jeff Merkley, co-chairperson of the 17-member commission, said that without proper guardrails to protect privacy and human rights, technology can be used by authoritarian regimes to control populations, prevent freedom of expression, and undermine democratic institutions.
China has 'the most pervasive surveillance state the world has ever seen' using technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and cloud computing, said Merkley, a U.S. senator from Oregon.
The government has amassed huge amounts of data from cell phones, personal computers, and security cameras to impose political and social control of targeted populations, he said.
'Nowhere do we see this more than in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region,' Merkley said.
For years, Chinese authorities have subjected Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities in Xinjiang to arbitrary arrests and restrictions on their religious practice and culture. The system is enforced by a pervasive digitized system that monitors the every move of residents through surveillance drones, facial recognition cameras, mobile phone scans, and an extensive police presence.
China's Digital Silk Road — a component of its Belt and Road Initiative to enhance digital connectivity abroad — is 'an intrusive ecosystem of internet architecture and surveillance technology aiming to expand the People's Republic of China's influence around the world,' Rep. Chris Smith said.
'Chinese authorities' relentless persecution of predominantly Muslims Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other Central Asian people in the country's Xinjiang region provides a disturbing preview of what these tools' misuse [would be] on an even broader scale,' he said.
China has held up to 1.8 million Uyghurs and others in 're-education' camps since 2017. It dismisses widely documented evidence, including testimony from former detainees and guards, that it has mistreated Muslims living inside and outside the camps.
Instead, Chinese officials contend that the camps are vocational training facilities used to prevent religious extremism and terrorism in the region, which is home to about 12 million Uyghurs.
But Geoffrey Cain, author of a recent book on surveillance in China, told commission members that former camp detainees and Uyghur and Kazakh refugees he had interviewed told similar stories about Xinjiang's 'descent into a total surveillance dystopia.'
China uses its Integrated Joint Operations Platform to store data collected from police human inputs, camera surveillance and criminal and court histories. It then takes the information to determine whether Uyghurs are likely to commit a crime, Cain said. Local police interrogate and detain Uyghurs flagged by the system through notifications sent to the authorities' smartphones.
The technologies developed by Chinese tech firms such as telecom giant Huawei, facial recognition technology provider Megvii, and AI software provider SenseTime amount to a 'system of mass psychological torture,' he said.
Xinjiang minority residents have a 'feeling of constantly being watched not by humans, but by crude software algorithms designed to predict future crimes and acts of terrorism with great inaccuracy,' Cain said.
'The reasons for detention could be as far-flung as whether they went through the front or back door, whether they began a physical exercise routine suddenly, and whether they had the flu and were simply late for work that day,' Cain told the commission.
There was no immediate response about the hearing from the Chinese government.
'Situation could have been far worse'
The hearing came two days after a three-hour virtual meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to discuss bilateral relations.
During the meeting, Biden underscored U.S. concerns about human rights in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong, according to a briefing the following day by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. He did not elaborate on what was said.
Dolkun Isa, president of the Germany-based World Uyghur Congress, said he was grateful that Biden broached China's atrocities against the Uyghurs during the virtual summit with Xi.
'If it was not for America's condemnation of China committing genocide against Uyghurs, our situation could have been far worse today,' he told RFA on Tuesday.
'The Biden administration must boycott the Beijing Winter Olympics,' Isa said. 'If it doesn't, it'll only embolden China to continue to commit the genocide.'
In June, the U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on China urged Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, to postpone the 2022 Beijing Games and to relocate them if the host government did not end its human rights abuses.
The U.S. government has declared that the China's campaign of abuse against Uyghurs in Xinjiang amounts to crimes against humanity and genocide.
On the same day Biden and Xi met, the 2021 China Xinjiang Development Forum was held in Beijing to highlight the success of the Belt and Road Initiative and the important role Xinjiang has played, while accusing Washington of using the issue to weaken China.
'The U.S.-led Western anti-China forces time and again manufactured Xinjiang related empty claims such as ‘genocide,' ‘forced labor,' and ‘forced sterilization' and used so-called human rights issues to harshly interfere in China's internal affairs,' said Jiang Jianguo, vice minister of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Propaganda Department.

198;Southeast Asia will feel economic, political fallout from a more powerful Xi Jinping;A Commentary Zachary Abuza;2022-10-26 19:09:30;full;https://www.rfa.org/english/commentaries/china-xi-southeastasia-10262022145045.html;rfa.org;Regional economy driver China is every Southeast Asian country's largest trading partner.;"The Chinese Communist Party's 20th Congress saw the thorough consolidation of power by Xi Jinping, elected to a third term, with a leadership that is personally loyal to him. No leader since Mao consolidated this amount of political power. China's importance as a trade partner and regional power means that this will be felt across Southeast Asia economically, politically, as well as in the diplomatic and security realm.
What may be good for Xi politically is not good for China economically. Xi stacked the Politburo and its Standing Committee with ideologues and loyalists; there are no pro-economic reform advocates left and corporate China is not represented.
Even before the 20th Congress, the Chinese economy had slowed as a result of the draconian zero-covid policy and Xi's assault on the dynamic privately owned tech sector. But the markets reacted sharply to Xi's consolidation of power.  
The stock market index collapsed as soon as the markets opened on Monday. There was a major selloff on all indexes and some $2.47 billion of foreign funds immediately withdrew from the China market. 
There's a real concern that the informal tax on the wealthy, known as the 'Common Prosperity' donations, will become larger and more compulsory. 
Capital flight is skyrocketing as high-net-worth individuals seek to move their funds to the safety of foreign jurisdictions. Money is flowing out of China as fast as possible. The Financial Times reported that the number of private Chinese family investments in Singapore nearly doubled from 400 to 700 since late 2020.
No one will speak truth to power in China anymore. Surrounded by sycophants, Xi is more likely to pursue policies that cannot be reversed.
This has an immediate impact on Southeast Asia as every country's largest trading partner is China, particularly those that are still largely dependent on the export of raw materials. 
China, which has been  a major source of foreign investment in the region is seeing its GDP growth continue to slow, now below 5 percent for the year. 
While capital flight may help some sectors in Southeast Asia, the gains will be narrow, and not compensate for the loss of China as the driver of economic growth in the region.

A changing Belt and Road Initiative
While the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is still state policy, Xi's signature program of infrastructure lending for projects to boost China's trade  with Asia and Africa is a diminished initiative. In 2018 and 2019, even before the pandemic, BRI lending dropped precipitously. The two state-owned development banks that were responsible for 75 percent of BRI funding, saw lending collapse. Overall lending in 2020 was 58 percent from its 2018 peak. 
Very clearly, many BRI projects are underwater and debt servicing had slowed. In 2018-19, China quietly renegotiated the repayment terms of $16 billion in loans. The pandemic caused a further slowdown in lending. 
Though BRI projects recommenced in 2020, they are considerably smaller in scale and amount.
Xi will not abandon the BRI. It's his vanity project and too associated with him to dismantle. Indeed, it was mentioned five times in the Oct. 16 Political Report to the congress, compared to just twice in 2017. 
The BRI will likely move away from physical infrastructure and focus on fiber optic cables, 5G and 6G, and the export of artificial intelligence/smart cities. Emphasizing the Digital Silk Road serves many of China's interests. It deepens their control over the internet and protocols, routes more traffic through Chinese servers, and gets other countries to adopt Chinese software and norms. The export of their digital authoritarian model will be a key priority. 
Analysts are still divided on what the Congress means for Taiwan, a major factor in region-wide stability. On the one hand, Xi's report was fairly pragmatic and made clear that there would be no quick move to invade the island, though he refused to renounce the use of force. Taiwan was mentioned only nine times in the report, compared to 12 in 2017, and the report offered no change in the existing policy.
Although Xi remains focused on PLA modernization by 2027, which obviously includes all Taiwan contingencies, his personnel selection for the Central Military Commission (CMC) also suggest caution. 
The CMC has little in the way of operational experience, in particular joint experience, with the exception of its two vice chairmen. While it includes the commander of the ground forces, the CMC is dominated by the army and lacks representation from the Strategic Rocket Forces, PLA-Navy, PLA-Air Force, i.e. the service arms that would be most involved in an invasion of or an attack on Taiwan. 
Of course there's always the chance of a miscalculation or uncontrolled escalation. China still sees a very narrow window of opportunity to reunify Taiwan.
But Xi and the CCP cannot afford anything other than a decisive military victory over Taiwan that does not escalate into a protracted conflict with the United States and others. The reputational cost to the regime for failing to achieve a clear-cut victory would be astronomical.

Downsides for security and the economy
That's actually not good for Southeast Asia. A limited conflict in the South China Sea against a much weaker adversary, where they can control the escalatory cycle, far away from the prying eyes of their ultranationalist public, is a very good opportunity for the PLA to gain some joint warfighting experience. 
As such, there will be a harder line and a more aggressive stance in the South China Sea. 
But we're in new territory here. Xi has absolute and unrestricted power; there are no institutional checks on him, which makes security in Southeast Asia far less predictable.  
Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who successfully executed Xi Jinping's 'wolf warrior' diplomacy featuring combative, jingoistic envoys who hectored their host countries on social media, was elevated to the 24-man Politburo. He will replace Yang Jiechi as the director of the general office of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission. 
On the Politburo Standing Committee is Wang Huning, the top ideology czar who ensured that 'Xi Jinping Thought' was enshrined in the constitution. Wang is also a fervent nationalist and really the driving force behind the assertive nationalism and the BRI that were the hallmarks of Xi's first decade in office.
Xi's army of wolf warrior diplomats will continue their hawkish rhetoric, despite the fact that public opinion towards China across Southeast Asia is starting to harden.
It's important that both the Minister of State Security and the Minister of Public Security, for the first time sit on the Politburo. 
This underscores the regime's obsession with security, but it also matters in Southeast Asia, where the long arm of China's law has been felt, with demands for the repatriation of dissidents and Uyghurs. 
The governments of Southeast Asia are clearly afraid of being pulled into great power competition between the United States and China. No state wants to be forced to chose sides, as both countries are critically important economic partners. 
For the past several years, Southeast Asians have largely blamed Washington for destabilizing actions, including the U.S. Navy's Freedom of Navigation operations (FONOPs) in the South China Sea  or Speaker Nancy Pelosi's July 2022 visit to Taiwan. 
Now, however, Xi made clear that he is going to pursue a much more confrontational policy towards the United States. But most importantly, China looks set to continue to undermine the rules-based international order that has been the foundation for Southeast Asia's spectacular economic growth.

199;Asian Countries Welcome G7's Answer to China's One Belt, One Road Program;;2021-06-23 19:38:25;full;https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/program-06232021151152.html;rfa.org;The US-led Build Back Better World (B3W) initiative is scant in details, though, and some countries' leaders say they now want more information.;"Bangladesh and nations in Southeast Asia are welcoming the Group of Seven's new answer to China's One Belt, One Road initiative, saying it will be another source for financing their burgeoning infrastructure needs.
But because the U.S.-led Build Back Better World Partnership (B3W) initiative is scant in details, officials of some governments in the region and analysts say they also are waiting for more information to see how it can help their countries. China has an eight-year head start and has pumped huge amounts of money into its global infrastructure-building program (OBOR).
The new initiative, announced this month at the G7 summit in Cornwall, England, promises sustainable and value-driven infrastructure investment to the tune of 'hundreds of billions of dollars' in low- and middle-income countries in the coming years.
The program will help narrow a U.S. $40 trillion need for infrastructure projects across the developing world, President Joe Biden said in announcing the new initiative.
B3W is 'a good opportunity for us,' Bangladesh Planning Minister Abdul Mannan told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service, this week.
'We will try to exploit the opportunity for our development efforts. Other than the Chinese sources, B3W would allow us to explore funds for infrastructure development in Bangladesh,' he said.
Thailand, too, 'welcomes' the G7 initiative and views it and Beijing's OBOR initiative as 'mutually reinforcing,' Thanee Sangrat, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told BenarNews.
'Both aim to strengthen connectivity and create resilient supply chains in our region,' he said.
The Philippines welcomes B3W 'but to see and to actually receive it is to believe [it],' presidential spokesman Harry Roque told BenarNews.
Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest and most populous country, is also waiting to see how B3W investments are made, according to Jodi Mahardi, spokesman for the investment ministry.
'We welcome the B3W development initiative proposed by the G-7, but we want to see the implementation. There have been many U.S.-led initiatives that are lacking in realization,' Jodi told BenarNews.
'The schemes must be flexible, based on the needs of partner countries, not on what Western countries see as good. I used the word ‘partner' because we don't want the relationship to be between donors and recipients, we want it to be [cooperation] between equals.'
BenarNews contacted Malaysia's investment agency, the trade ministry, and the minister in charge of economics, but officials did not immediately return calls seeking comment.
Economists and political analysts in these countries said B3W investments would be good alternative sources of funding for infrastructure projects.
Ahsan H. Mansur, an economist and executive director of the Policy Research Institute in Dhaka, described the G7 initiative as 'a big opportunity for us, the developing and low-income countries.'
'This is because now we have an alternative option to get funds from,' he told BenarNews.
B3W is not fully fleshed out yet but, in principle, is a good funding source for Indonesia, said Fithra Faisal Hastiadi, executive director of Next Policy, an Indonesian think-tank.
'I think B3W will be a good alternative for Indonesia as a non-aligned country. But I think the problem is the initiative is still half-baked,' Fithra told BenarNews.
Walden Bello, co-chair of the Board of Focus on the Global South, a Bangkok think-tank, was blunter. He dismissed the G7 initiative as 'purely reactive.'
'[A]nd purely reactive programs tend to be put together in a hurry with little serious thought to follow-through,' he said.
For Oh Ei Sun, an international relations specialist based in Singapore, B3W will lead to countries in the region 'playing both sides to see who will be able to offer more.'
'It's all about the money, let's not kid ourselves,' Oh told BenarNews.
Unveiled in 2013, OBOR is Chinese President Xi Jinping's signature geopolitical program that aims to build a modern-day Silk Road through a network of ports, railways, roads, and trade routes to connect China to markets in Southeast Asia, South Asia, and beyond.
OBOR began eight years ago with a focus on investments around the world in energy, infrastructure, and transportation projects. Estimates about the size of OBOR investments vary widely – from $1 trillion to $8 trillion.
According to a London-based financial data firm Refinitiv, in January 2020 OBOR comprised close to 3,000 projects valued at $3.87 trillion.
Ongoing construction in Southeast Asia includes the $6 billion Bandung-Jakarta high-speed rail project in Indonesia and the $1.3 billion Kyaukphyu deep-water port in Myanmar, among others.
In Bangladesh, China has provided nearly $7 billion for nine development projects since October 2016, according to data from the Ministry of Finance.
‘More equitable way'
Some may see B3W and OBOR as complementary, but President Biden and the G7 see the two initiatives as fundamentally different.
'The point is that what's happening is that China has this Belt and Road Initiative, and we think that there's a much more equitable way to provide for the needs of countries around the world,' Biden told a press conference in Cornwall on June 13, according to a White House transcript.
'And we believe that will not only be good for the countries, but it'll be good for the entire world and represent values that our democracies represent, and not autocratic lack of values.'
The democracies he referred to are the U.S. and fellow G7 members Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom.
Biden was highlighting that China is not a democracy, and alluding to what critics have said is Beijing's practice of predatory lending or debt-trap diplomacy in OBOR.
For instance, analysts point to Chinese loans to Sri Lanka, in particular, as a cautionary tale for nations planning to borrow from Beijing.
In 2017, a Chinese state-owned company took over a majority stake in Sri Lanka's strategic Hambantota port after Colombo struggled to repay its loans from China.
B3W, on the other hand, emphasizes what it calls 'enhanced multilateral finance,' the G7 said in a communiqué issued from Cornwall on June 13.
Multilateral development banks and other international financial Institutions 'have evolved to embody the highest standards for project planning, implementation, social and environmental safeguards, and analytical capability,' the communiqué said.
'We emphasize the importance of transparent, open, economically efficient, fair and competitive standards for lending and procurement, also in line with debt sustainability, and the adherence of international rules and standards for major creditor countries,' the joint statement said.
B3W-related investments are to be guided by standards such as those promoted by the updated Blue Dot Network, G7's communique added.
The Blue Dot Network, announced by the United States, Japan, and Australia in November 2019, assesses and certifies infrastructure projects for environmental sustainability, financial transparency, and economic impact.
‘Thailand shares G7's endeavor'
Thailand, for one, especially welcomes the B3W's focus on transparent and sustainable investments through clear and established international mechanisms, said Thanee, the foreign ministry spokesman.
'Thailand shares the G7's endeavor in developing high-quality infrastructure with a fresh approach that advocates responsibility for the environment and for the people; fiscal sustainability; the participation of international investors and financial institutions; and compatibility with global standards by adopting international norms,' Thanee said.
'[T]he B3W initiative … supports our priorities.'
B3W's priority investment areas will be climate, health and health security, digital technology, and gender equity and equality, according to a White House fact sheet about the initiative.
But transparency in investment, and funding in gender equity and health projects may be seen by some nations as 'pet projects' that come 'with strings attached,' said Oh, a senior fellow at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs.
'These are important only in the eyes of advanced liberal democracies' and not considered as vital in some other countries, Oh told BenarNews.
'The G7 is also harping on transparency which is in not the norm in most parts of the developing world,' Oh told BenarNews.
Oh, Indonesian economist Fithra, and other analysts cast doubt on whether the G7 countries, however advanced and industrialized, have the financial chops to compete with China's massive OBOR investments.
Bello, the analyst based in Bangkok, noted that China's initial commitment to OBOR was $1 trillion in 2013-2014, but had now ballooned to – by some estimates – around $4 trillion.
'Washington has already committed the bulk of what it plans to raise from taxes to the planned new U.S.-focused high-tech industrial policy program passed by the Senate over a week ago,' Bello told BenarNews, referring to the Innovation and Competition Act, which analysts say is intended to counter China.
'The biggest problem [for B3W] is the money, and with all these countries suffering fiscal crises, with the possible exception of Germany, where are they going to get the trillions of dollars to match China's investment?' 
European members of the G7, meanwhile, will have trouble convincing their citizens that infrastructure investments are needed around the world as they recover from the pandemic and the effects of Brexit, Fithra said.
'If they have to chip in for the initiative, where does the money come from? There will be opposition from their own people. So it's like a paper tiger,' he said.
Chan Hoi Cheong, a senior political and security risk analyst at Safeture AB's Malaysia branch, said B3W may have come too late in the geopolitical game.
'If B3W aims to capture the hearts and minds of Asian countries, it will have a lot of catching up to do,' Chan told BenarNews.

200;Cryptocurrency fever leads to dead end for some investors;Vietnamnet News;2021-07-01 01:45:00;timezone unknown;https://vietnamnet.vn/en/feature/cryptocurrency-fever-leads-to-dead-end-for-some-investors-751599.html;vietnamnet.vn;With total market capitalization value of $1.45 trillion as of June 21, the cryptocurrency ecosystem has attracted investors but has also been an ideal hiding place for illegal activities.;"01/07/2021    08:29 GMT+7 With total market capitalization value of $1.45 trillion as of June 21, the cryptocurrency ecosystem has attracted investors but has also been an ideal hiding place for illegal activities.Lawyer Luong Van ChuongIt was 9 am at an office in the central area of HCMC. The computer screen in front of Quoc Viet showed a series of charts, which reflected the ups and downs of many cryptocurrencies.Viet looked at the charts attentively. Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency with the name of the Japanese dog breed Shiba, had been the focus on exchanges.Dogecoin once reached its peak at 69cent/coin. This means that if investors spent $1,000 to buy Dogecoin in early 2021, when the cryptocurrency was priced at less than 1 cent, they would make a profit of $120,000, if noting that the current price is 69 cent. Dogecoin increased by 120 times just after several months.'Some people said Dogecoin has increased too sharply, so investors would suffer if betting on the currency. The charts showed abnormally sharp price increases with the prices increasing by 3-4 times just in the first week of May. Sharks have gone, so you will ‘die' if you touch it,' Viet said. .The word ‘shark' is used to talk about individuals or institutions holding large amounts of Bitcoins in the cryptocurrency market. They are believed to be able to drive the market as they want. Viet thinks that the galloping increase of the Dogecoin is unsafe.Not only Dogecoin, but Bitcoin also worries made the investor.'I once estimated that the Bitcoin price may reach $69,000, and investors would hold Bitcoin and not make transactions. The Bitcoin value can increase by $1,000 within several minutes. Its value goes up and down all the time. One month ago, the currency lost $10,000 per Bitcoin just within 30 minutes,' he said.Viet is not the only office worker that ‘plays' cryptocurrency. A survey of global consumers by Statista in 2020 showed that Vietnam ranked second in terms of the popularity of crytocurrency.Up to 21 percent of 1,000-1,400 polled individuals in Vietnam said they once used or owned cryptocurrencies. The figure can show a part of the picture about the ‘cryptocurrency rush'.Bitcoin is considered the ‘king of cryptocurrency', leading the cryptocurrency ecosystem, attracting investors with the value of $35,000 per Bitcoin, or 45 percent of total market capitalization value, as of June 21.Loopholes for tax evasion, money laundryWith anonymity and cross-border trade, cryptocurrency facilitates tax evasion and illegal remittances, payments and funding for illegal transactions. Criminals can convert money into Bitcoins and then, through e-wallets, remit money abroad without having to pay any kind of fee.On September 21, 2017, the first lawsuit on collecting tax arrears on the profit from cryptocurrency investment, was heard in Ben Tre.Arguing that cryptocurrency was a kind of asset and goods, the Ben Tre City Taxation Sub-department released a decision on collecting the personal income arrears of VND2.6 billion from Nguyen Viet Cuong, who traded cryptocurrency via internet from 2008 to 2013.Cuong sued the taxation agency for this decision. The Ben Tre provincial People's Court then released a decision on canceling the tax arrears decision. Since cryptocurrency was not legally considered a kind of good, the decision by the Ben Tre taxation agency was unreasonable.Citing the case, Lawyer Luong Van Chuong from the HCM City Bar Association, said that with anonymity and cross-border trade, cryptocurrency facilitates tax evasion and illegal remittances, payments and funding for illegal transactions. Criminals can convert money into Bitcoins and then, through e-wallets, remit money abroad without having to pay any kind of fee.This is the loophole that can be exploited for money laundering and money transfer from Vietnam to other countries. The remittance is used to buy properties or for other illegal activities.According to Chuong, money laundering via Bitcoin has not been seen in Vietnam, but found in the US.In late April 2021, FBI dismantled Silk Road, a big crime ring, and seized two e-wallets containing 174,000 Bitcoins. With Bitcoin value at $57,600 on May 1, 2021, the amount of Bitcoins exceeded $10 billion.With Blockchain, a user can send a digital asset through the Internet to another user, and this transaction is guaranteed to be safe, highly secure, and not easily modified. Therefore, it is difficult for state agencies to supervise and inspect once they suspect that the transactions are illegal.Nguyen Hoang Dung, a respected economist, said the convenience of cryptocurrency is undeniable, but many countries don't recognize the legitimacy of the ecosystem worth trillions of dollars in cyberspace because of high risks.'If you just need to sit at home but can make transactions of millions or billions of dollars with just mouse clicks, why wouldn't criminals do it?' he said. 'When the central bank cannot control this, it will be just an unlocked door which crimes are ready to go through.""Currently, Vietnam has no legal regulations governing activities related to cryptocurrencies and virtual assets.In August 2017, the Government released Decision 1255, assigning ministries to complete the legal framework on cryptocurrency management.On April 11, 2018, the PM issued Directive 10/CT-TTg on strengthening the management of activities related to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Quang DinhA delay in issuing official legal regulations on managing cryptocurrencies will cause a rise in the risks of fraud and theft related to virtual assets, experts have warned.Vietnam ranks 4th for profit earned from cryptocurrencies among Asian economies in 2020, only after China, Japan and South Korea.";vietnamnet.vn;6906;news;VN;en;['Vietnamnet News'];https://vnn-imgs-f.vgcloud.vn/2021/06/30/15/cryptocurrency-fever-leads-to-dead-end-for-some-investors.jpg;False;;12.6698065;8859a6ac78f4425297c65e39a9d4bcdd;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 3}

Free entrance. Death in toddler with viral meningitis reported in VietnamOne toddler in the Mekong Delta Province of Ben Tre died of viral meningitis, an inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord. Worse, the country has recorded 150 cases of meningitis from the beginning of the year.According to the data from the Ministry of health to the government office, in April alone, Vietnam has recorded 64 viral meningitis cases including one death in Ben Tre Province.The southern region has recorded eight cases of meningococcal meningitis with one death in Ho Chi Minh City's District 8. The country has seen a surge of meningococcal meningitis by 200 percent year-on-year.There has been change in seasonal patterns from dry to wet season in the southern region; therefore, resulting in a spike in number of encephalitis and meningitis cases.Physicians of the City Children Hospital's Department of Infectious Disease said that in the middle of April, the department admitted ten cases of viral meningitis and encephalitis. Presently, medical workers are being treating 20 cases.Deputy Director of the City Children Hospital Nguyen Tran Nam warned that Japanese encephalitis can occur all year round, with a peak in the summer. The hospital has received one cases of Japanese encephalitis and one viral herpes encephalitis. There is no specific treatment for viral meningitis whereas the case-fatality rate among those with encephalitis can be as high as 30 percentEncephalitis and meningitis are on the upward trend in the Mekong Delta region.Associate Professor Cao Huu Nghia from Pasteur Institute in HCMC shared the peak of encephalitis and meningitis are from April to August. Averagely, 100 people are infected with the fatal disease and half of them died of it within 24 hours without timely treatment. Worse, 8-15 percent of patients with encephalitis died because of severe complications though they receive timely treatment.According to Dr. Nghia, meningococcal meningitis is considered as ""death disease"" because about 5-20 percent of the population in Vietnam carry meningococcal bacteria in their nose and throat without becoming sick. Meningococcal bacteria are very common and live naturally in the nose and throat. The bacteria are present in saliva and can be spread through close contact with the saliva of a carrier.Meningococcal disease can be difficult to diagnose because initial symptoms are usually similar to a bad cold or flu. The illness may develop slowly over a couple of days or may worsen rapidly over a few hours. Symptoms do not appear in any particular order and some may not occur at all.Symptoms that may occur in adults and children include high temperature (fever) – possibly with cold hands and feet, headache, neck stiffness, sensitivity to bright lights, vomiting and sometimes diarrhoea, drowsiness and seizures (convulsions).Medical workers advised parents to take their children to clinics for vaccination to prevent the dangerous disease. Additionally, people should keep their personal hygiene.Ministry implements project to improve students' awareness of startupThe Ministry of Education and Training has just issued a plan to implement the project ""Support for students by 2025 ' which aims to improve students' awareness of entrepreneurial startup.Moreover, the Ministry's project will help students to proactively access to the supporting system inside and outside their schools.The project guides educational and training institutions to organize models to support student business ideas and startup opportunities as well as select typical startup models for publicizing.Additionally, the Ministry directed schools and departments of Education and Training to build a startup environment so that students can experience their startup projects.

They have gradually moved from print to digital devices to consume the content they want in the most readily available format.Recently, Director of the Authority of Publication, Printing and Distribution under the Ministry of Information and Communication Nguyen Nguyen has released some startling number that 30 percent of Vietnamese people read books regularly, 26 percent do not read books, 44 percent only read books occasionally.However, up to 70 percent of Vietnamese people use the Internet. This towering number of people surfing the internet shows an irreversible trend of the urgent digital transformation.Digital transformation also allows publishers to repurpose material by chunking it into modules, depending on the rights and licensing agreements. Additionally, metadata can help publishers optimize search capabilities so that it is easier to discover and use the content.First printed in 2012, so far the book A hundred years of finite of Phuong Nam Book and Publisher Association of Writers by author Pham Lu An, a joint pseudonym of writers Pham Cong Luan and Dang Nguyen Dong Vy has been reprinted 30 times, with 300,000 copies.Although the book has been well-received and it has gone straight to be one of the books on the best-seller list, the two authors have lately decided to empower Fonos, a copyrighted audiobook app that has just been on the market for nearly a year now, to add a new format to the work. In the coming time, some other works such as Lost in the world, Ways of childhood, Find me in the field of the two writers will also be transformed into audiobooks by Fonos.Author Dang Nguyen Dong Vy shared that with the development of technology, readers have different habits of reading. Publishers ought to bring information, content and knowledge to readers; therefore, they need to take advantage of digital technologies to satisfy readers' needs. Now, the book A hundred years of finite was published under three forms including paper book, Ebook (electronic book) and Audiobook. These three versions serve different needs of readers.According to those working in the publishing industry, digital transformation is irreversible. As a matter of fact, readers no longer only read and absorb knowledge through paper books but they also enjoy e-book, Audiobook, Clipbook, and podcasts. After nearly 2 years of launch, the audiobook application Voiz FM has currently had more than 300,000 users with 2,000 books. Moreover, users of the application Voiz FM have paid for more than 15 million minutes or averagely they pay about 2-3 million minutes per month.In addition to audiobooks, WeWe Company, which owns the Voiz FM audiobook application, also has a Podcast, which can be considered as an audiobook format and a useful channel for book introduction.Le Hoang Thach, CEO of WeWe shared that at first many people said that Vietnamese people will not pay for listening to books after hearing about the copyrighted audiobook plan. However, after two years, the money the company received from the audience has encouraged the company staff.After nearly 10 years participating in the Ebook market, the Ho Chi Minh City General Publishing House has produced 3,000 books. Established in 2014, Waka Company has presently more than 3.2 million users and more than 13,000 e-books in the fields of business, skills, literature, science-technology, culture - society, for children. This company also constantly updates and supplements the best-seller books on the market of publishers, publishing companies, domestic and foreign authors.According to Bui Xuan Duc, Director of the Library of General Science of Ho Chi Minh City, digital transformation is an inevitable trend now, especially when the development of Covid-19 is complicated which the government has imposed social distancing. The library has been digitizing rare and unique documents to serve users on different levels. The number of publications that we have digitized is about 10,000 copies excluding newspapers and magazines. Furthermore, some books are on the library's website so that readers can read books at home.Nguyen Thi Diem Phuong, Head of Sachweb Department of HCMC General Publishing House, said that the publishing house has produced 3,000 electronic books in ten years. The Ebook manufacturing process is extremely time- consuming whereas the price is cheap. Worse, she added that piracy has restricted the market of units making copyrighted e-books.In addition, one inconvenience of the Ebook type is that there is not yet a shared app to serve the needs of readers to read e-books. Currently, each unit has its app, if readers want to read books of any unit, they must download these apps to their phones or tablets.Diem Phuong admitted she has to download the apps of other publishing houses if she wants to read books. Accordingly, she has high expectations on the policy of digital transformation that management agency on the technology platform investment will create a common playground for all publishing houses to make e-books. There should be a platform, like an ecosystem where publishers and publishing houses put their e-books on it, readers just download a general app to read all books.Meanwhile, Director of Omega Plus Book Company Vu Trong Dai said in order to quickly respond to the needs of today's users, it is necessary to be more open to electronic publishing activities.Director Dai said that previously, Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Manh Hung introduced the program"" Make in Vietnam' to encourage businesses, technology organizations and non-technology organizations to invest more in Vietnamese own products in this field.According to Mr. Dai, the Minister's call includes technology in the publishing sector. To have a breakthrough in publishing technology, state management agencies' support in the publishing-media field is needed especially for fledgling start-ups.The Authority of Publication, Printing and Distribution's data also shows that there has been a positive change in the type of Ebook. Specifically, 213 electronic publications registered in 2018 and 2,050 publications were released with 1.5 million hits in 2020. The number of publishers goes up from five in 2019 to nine now.Ca Mau Province's local foods rank among top 100 Vietnamese specialties, giftsSalted Fish Hotpot and U Minh Forest Honey of the rural district of U Minh in the southernmost coastal province of Ca Mau have been recognized as one of the Top 100 Vietnamese specialties and Top 100 Vietnamese gift specialties respectively by the Vietnam Record Association (VietKings).The province is well-known for dish of fermented fish hot pot with wild vegetables and wild honey taken from U Minh mangrove forest which is the most famous destination in Ca Mau.On this occasion, the Department of Culture, Sport and Tourism of Ca Mau Province organized a cooking competition promoting the local dish of fermented fish.In February, Nam Can Sea Crab was also named among Top 100 Vietnamese specialties while Ca Mau Dried Shrimp was previously recognized as one of the Top 100 Vietnamese gift specialties.U Minh mangrove forest covers an area of about 2,000 square kilometer in the provinces of Kien Giang and Ca Mau.

Meanwhile, Hue also hired two apartments in the same district for 11 other Chinese people.Thao was paid VND140 million (USD6,086) and Hue received VND4 million (USD173.91) as commission.After being raided by Hanoi police on April 20, one of the Chinese people staying at facilities hired by Thao had fled.Sixteen of 17 Chinese illegal migrants in the ring have been sent to a local quarantine site.The police have also prosecuted Ou Guo Pei.Anti-epidemic work needs to be specific, practical and responsibleOver the past few days, the COVID-19 epidemic situation in the country has witnessed complicated developments. Risk factors came from both outside (status of people entering illegally from epidemic countries) and inside (management and isolation in some places did not comply with regulations).Warnings about a fourth and subsequent outbreaks, more intense than the previous ones, have become a reality. Epidemic prevention and control in many localities also revealed a number of loopholes, requiring authorities at all levels to step in with specific and practical action.At a meeting on April 30, the Prime Minister asked the whole political system, on the basis of their functions, duties and powers, especially the heads of party committees, administrations, the Fatherland Front at all levels and other socio-political organisations to take drastic actions to prevent and fight the epidemic.However, there are still many localities that are not acting in an urgent way, even some localities allowinggatherings in public areas such as beaches, amusement parks, tourism sites, etc. without strictly implementing anti-epidemic measures under the guidance of the Ministry of Health (MoH). If COVID-19 infections occur at those events, they can very easily become 'super contagious' events. Many countries around the world have paid a hefty price for risking large-scale events, which then let the pandemic spread, even to the point of being out of control.Therefore, localities need to further strengthen their epidemic prevention and control measures; promote the role of the heads of authorities and the consensus of the whole society; resolutely stop organising unnecessary crowd-gathering activities such as festivals, pedestrian streets and night markets. Any events taking place must comply with epidemic prevention and control regulations as well as strictly implement preventive measures.In particular, provinces and cities experiencing the epidemic such as Hanoi, Ha Nam, Vinh Phuc and Hung Yen have to mobilise to the utmost their forces, focus on tracing people related to COVID-19 cases in order to effectively quarantine and prevent the epidemic from spreading at even the lowest level. More than ever, the principle of ""prevention is better than cure"" should be upheld. All provinces and cities must activate all epidemic prevention and control plans to be ready for therapid detection, zoning and encirclement of epidemic outbreaks; complying with the 5K recommendations ofthe MoH.Among the COVID-19 cases in recent times, there have been cases of infection spreading in the quarantine area (in Yen Bai) or not complying with regulations after concentrated isolation (patient No. 2899 in Ha Nam). Therefore, localities need to tighten and strictly comply with regulations oegarding isolation under the guidance of specialised agencies. Quarantine areas must ensure the security of the process from the time of pick-up at the airport, movement to quarantine areas and handover to localities after concentrated isolation.In the coming days, after the holidays of April 30 and May 1, many big cities such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City will welcome back a large number of people, including many people coming back from epidemic-hit areas. Therefore, localities should have solutions to closely manage and supervise holiday-makers, especially those returning from epidemic-hit areas. It is appropriate for those returning to the city to make a medical report or report to the local authorities of their place of residence. That not only helps prevent illness for themselves, but is also their responsibility towards the whole society.Vietnam Children's Fine Arts Awards 2021 to be heldThe Vietnam Children's Fine Arts Awards 2021 is scheduled to be held to encourage and facilitate the development of children's fine arts inside and outside school, according to the Department of Fine Arts, Photography and Exhibition under the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism.The Organizing Committee will begin to receive entries from May 25 to July 5, at the head office of the Department of Fine Arts, Photography and Exhibition at No.38 Cao Ba Quat street, Ba Dinh district, Hanoi.It is expected there will be 400 excellent works selected to participate in the Vietnam Children's Fine Arts Exhibition in 2021. From these, the Organising Committee will present three first prizes, six second prizes, ten third prizes, and 20 consolation prizes in addition to 10 collective prizes.Exhibition introduces 100 works of painter Linh ChiAn exhibition was opened at the Vietnam National Fine Arts Museum in Hanoi on the afternoon of May 1 to feature 100 paintings from the career of artist Linh Chi.Artist Linh Chi's real name is Nguyen Tai Luong, born in 1921 in Vinh Yen (Vinh Phuc Province). With the knowledge of painting accumulated through lectures from many famous teachers in high school, he often carried the easel to many rural and mountainous areas of Hoa Binh, Lang Son and Tuyen Quang.From 1951 to 1953, during the nation's resistant war, painter Linh Chi attended a course led by famous painter To Ngoc Van. While immersing in the arduous life of the army and people in the long war, Linh Chi became a painter with his own personality, leaving many imprints in the hearts of the art-loving public.At the end of the course, he was assigned to work for the national printer, then moved to work at the Xunhasaba book import and export agency. Amidst the busy work, the artist continued to compose and created many good works.The humanistic value in Linh Chi's paintings is the harmonious combination between the behavioural attitude to reality and artistic ideals. His paintings are always closest to people, what people see and can feel. People love his paintings not only because of the poetic scenery, but also the harmony of shapes and colours that increase the aesthetic pleasure of viewers.He also devoted many works on the topic of mountainous ethnic groups, with special feelings about the lives of people of different ethnic groups.Many of his paintings are being displayed at the Vietnam National Fine Arts Museum and in many private collections in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden and Japan.During his career, artist Linh Chi held many exhibitions to introduce his artworks.He passed away on March 1, 2016, at the age of 96. This year also marks his 100th birthday.Hanoi FC keep title-race hopes alive with Saigon FC winHanoi FC kindled their hopes of making the top six title contenders in the second phase of V.League 1 by defeating Saigon FC 3-1 at home in the penultimate round of the first phase on May 2 thanks to goals from Geovane and Bruno.The shining display of the foreign players earned the former champions their first victory under new manager Park Choong-kyun, lifting them to seventh in the table with 16 points, just a single point adrift of the top six.Meanwhile, the loss pushed Saigon FC down to 13th position, standing just three points clear of bottom-place Song Lam Nghe An, who conceded three unanswered goals against Ho Chi Minh City on the same day.Geovane contributed significantly to Hanoi FC's Sunday triumph. The Brazilian forward moved the hosts off the mark after only three minutes lofting a skillful left-footed curler over goalkeeper Van Phong toward the far top corner.Hanoi FC almost doubled their advantage 16 minutes later, however, Quang Hai's impromptu volley was denied by the crossbar.In the 28th minute, Cao Van Trien delivered a subtle pass from midfield to unmarked Manh Cuong, who burst into the box to take the ball before shooting past goalie Bui Tan Truong in a one-on-one to level the score.After the break, Hanoi FC strengthened their attacks and created a number of clear-cut opportunities. It was not until the 67th minute that Park Choong-kyun's side restored their lead with Geovane heading Thai Quy's left-flank cross home to beat Van Phong, who had showed amazing reflexes to deny Bruno's close-range shot just seconds earlier.In the 79th minute, Bruno punished the guests' loose defence by firing a powerful header from Van Quyet's cross to seal a convincing 3-1 victory for Hanoi FC.Hanoi FC are now level with Topenland Binh Dinh and SHB Da Nang on 16 points. They will need a win against bottom-place Song Lam Nghe An in the last round of the first phase on May 7 to firmly secure a place in the title campaign's second phase.Leaders Hoang Anh Gia Lai (HAGL) saw their seven-game winning run halted following a 2-2 home draw with Becamex Binh Duong, while title holders Viettel FC edged past SHB Da Nang 2-1 away to move within three points of HAGL.Hong Linh Ha Tinh climbed to 10th place after beating Nam Dinh FC 3-2, extending their winning streak to four matches.Lee Nguyen scored a brace to help Ho Chi Minh City defeat Hai Phong FC 3-0 to escape the relegation zone. Meanwhile, V.League 1 newbies Topenland Binh Dinh played out a 1-1 draw against third-placed Quang Ninh Coal.Two more metro trains set to arrive in HCMC next weekTwo metro trains with three carriages each of HCMC's first metro line project linking Ben Thanh Market in District 1 with Suoi Tien Theme Park left Japan on May 1 and are expected to arrive in the city on May 10.The trains were manufactured at Japan's Kasado factory. After completing customs procedures at a local port, the two trains will be transported to Long Binh Depot in Thu Duc City in the following three to four days, the local media reported.Four other trains of the metro line will have six carriages each. Of these, two trains will be transported to HCMC next month and the other two in July.HCMC's metro line No. 1 will have 17 trains, with the first phase using the three-car trains capable of carrying 930 passengers and the following phase using six-carriage ones, which are all manufactured in Japan.The first train arrived in Khanh Hoi Port in October last year and is at Long Binh Depot for an upcoming trial operation.Over 26,000 storm-affected people supportedMore than 26,000 poor and near-poor people affected by recent storms and floods in central provinces such as Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Thua Thien Hue have been provided stabilization support.The United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the local authorities and the Red Cross have completed the repair and reinforcement of storm-resilient features for more than 3,300 damaged houses and provided 3,323 gender-responsive household kits for poor and near-poor households in these provinces.This emergency assistance is part of the ""Response to Disasters in Vietnam"" project funded by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund. In addition, UNDP has supported the construction of 20 new safe houses with full storm- and flood-resilient features in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. Those in Ly Son Island, Quang Ngai Province, have particularly more resilient features and are powered by solar panels.Since last October, central Vietnam has been impacted by a series of successive intense storms and record-level floods. According to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, more than 230 people were reported dead or missing and at least 380,000 houses were flooded, damaged or destroyed.In the aftermath, tens of thousands of the most vulnerable were left with nothing but damaged houses, destroyed livelihoods and ruined crops. Many people lost almost all of their household possessions to the floodwaters and many others became homeless, making the lives of the poor and near-poor, who already have minimal resources, even more difficult.Addressing the handover of the new resilient and repaired houses to local low-income households on April 29, Tran Van Tan, vice chairman of Quang Nam Province, said, 'We highly appreciate UNDP's efforts and timely assistance in building and repairing the damaged houses of the poor to help them recover from disasters. We hope to continue to receive support to help vulnerable people have a better life.""Representing the poor households who received the support, Luu Thi Phuong from Que Son District thanked UNDP, the Provincial People's Committee and the Red Cross, saying, 'Without this support, I don't know when my sons and I would be able to build such a resilient house.'According to Caitlin Wiesen, UNDP resident representative in Vietnam, the resilient houses have saved thousands of lives during the historic floods and storms that battered the central region. However, there is still a long way to go to reach all those in need. For this reason, UNDP is also organizing a crowdfunding campaign, 'Safe houses save lives', to support the construction of an initial 100 new houses in highly vulnerable locations.'In particular, our houses on Ly Son Island will have a new and strengthened design addressing the special conditions of the wind forces impacting the islands and a rooftop solar system capable of providing a sufficient lighting system for the households,' she added.Moreover, with the support of the Green Climate Fund, the Government of Vietnam and UNDP, more than 430 safe houses able to withstand storms and floods have been built for the poor and near-poor in Quang Nam Province from 2018 until now.Reforestation may be life-altering to ethnic peopleGiven the vast area of forested land still available, Ho A Lai and his peers of Van Kieu ethnic people in Kim Thuy Commune are expecting to expand their initial acreage of forests from 734.32 hectares to about 5,000 hectares. Their wood will be branded with FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certification within the next five years. To them, this may be a life-changing event.Ho A Lai, a member of the Van Kieu ethnic minority in Kim Thuy Commune in Quang Binh Province's Le Thuy District, has recently been awarded with a sustainable forest management certification. The certification, issued by the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council), is valid from March 26, 2021 to March 25, 2026. Quang Binh's Le Thuy is also the first district in the province to be granted with an FSC certification in line with the household management model.Mr. Lai is one among more than 100 first forest owners who registered for the participation in the above model in the hope that the reforestation in line with FSC standards may help them earn better income. Mr. Lai's Kim Thuy can boast a strength in reforestation as forested land accounts for a third of the commune's total acreage. Despite the great potential in forestry, until 2019, poverty remained rampant in the commune where up to 46% of its households were still poor, according to statistics released by the local communal authorities. In some hamlets with a population of Van Kieu ethnic people, say, Rum Ho Hamlet, the poverty rate was as high as 75%. In accordance with the FSC sustainable forest management certification, forest owners are encouraged to switch from unsustainable to sustainable cultivation mode via a breakaway from the habit of burning down vegetation following forest exploitation, plowing the top surface of forests, using plant protection chemicals and dumping thrash in the forest, to name but a few.This process also seeks to request forest owners to strictly protect vulnerable biological habitats, such as brooks, indigenous plants and local wild animals. Also under the protection are historic relics, such as former bomb creates or signs of biodiversity.In addition, the FSC standards encourage forest owners to build their own plants to manage their forested land, apply work safety measures and exploit forests at an appropriate rate suitable to environmental protection.In return, these strict regulations mean that FSC-branded wood products are always preferred by wood processors worldwide at prices 15-20% higher than normal prices.According to statistics obtained from the General Department of Vietnam Customs, despite considerable effects by Covid-19, the country's export sales of timber and wood products reached US$12.37 billion in 2020, a rise of 16.2% over 2019. As Vietnam's integration into the global marketplace intensifies, the demand for FSC-certificated wood has become increasingly urgent and is now actually a matter of life and death to enterprises in the woodwork industry, especially after the Voluntary Partnership Agreements/Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade Action Plan (VPA/FLEGT) has come into effect. Although Vietnam is a country having great potential for forestry development, her wood enterprises are still lacking wood materials and FSC-certified wood products.Previously, Ho A Lai and his ethnic peers mostly practiced nomadic farming as they burnt out forests to turn them into fields for some time. After several years when the fertile top soil had gone, they let the fields untouched for a few years so that the land could recover to a certain extent before they came back. Over the past several years, nomadic farming has been terminated as a result of the State's more stringent forest management. At the same time, as many Van Kiet ethnic people have sold their forested land to others, they no longer have enough land for the practice of nomadic farming.Since a decade ago, locals have begun to grow hybrid acacia trees, focusing on some areas, to sell them to be used as pulp in the paper production industry. Hybrid acacia trees are often planted with extremely heavy density, from 4,000 to 5,000 trees per hectare, without trimming. After four years of growth, acacia trees can be exploited. This cycle may be shortened if their growers are in need of money. However, no trimming and heavy density will force the trees to grow slowly and decrease productivity because they lack space and nutrition.Exploitation only four years after being grown will also reduce commercial viability of the trees because this is the time they begin to accelerate growth, their wood remains immature, and their diameters are small and their weight is not great. Experience gained from many localities nationwide shows that acacia trees of six to eight years old would produce a weight double or thrice as much as four-year-old trees would. Such mature trees could then be sold for making timber, logs, or wood used in construction or wood materials for furniture, not for pulp. Consequently, its commercial value may be twice or thrice as much.In spite of the bigger economic benefit, Van Kieu ethnic minority groups have never done away with this way of hybrid acacia tree cultivation. They have stayed faithful to their habit of early exploitation for fear that storms may wipe away their trees. Otherwise, they are desperately in need of money or have no relations with buyers of FSC-brand wood. Nor do they have support in compiling files and expenses for the certification process.Those Van Kieu ethnic people groups stood a chance when they were assisted by a non-governmental project which gave them initial technical and financial support for the certification. This support has also allowed forest owners to set up their own association that represents them to receive the necessary certification and work with enterprises and State agencies in paperwork and product consumption.Given the vast area of forest land still available, Ho A Lai and his ethnic peers in Kim Thuy Commune are expecting to expand their initial acreage of forests from 734.32 hectares to about 5,000 hectares whose wood will be branded with FSC certification within the next five years. Six families of 28 caught entering Vietnam from Cambodia illegally by boatsBorder guards of the Vinh Xuong border crossing between Vietnam and Cambodia in Tan Chau Town in the Mekong Delta province of An Giang caught 28 Vietnamese Cambodian people who had illegally entered Vietnam by boats through the Tien River on May 1. Accordingly, the border force detected three cases of illegal entry into the country on the day featuring a total number of 28 people of six families. They were found in the Vinh Xuong Commune's Hamlet 5 while illegally crossing the Vietnam-Cambodia border by riding 14 boats on the Tien River, a branch of the Mekong River that connects the two countries.The border station asked them to return to the point of departure and comply with Covid-19 preventive and control measures issued by the local Government.The Vinh Xuong border crossing informed to the Cambodian functional departments, the Overseas Vietnamese Association in Cambodia and asked for coordination in the prevention and control of illegal immigration into Vietnam.Turkey drops PCR test requirement for Vietnamese citizens The decision is set to take place from May 15.Turkish authorities have removed the requirement for negative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for entry of citizens from 16 countries and territories, including Vietnam.In addition to Vietnam, those from Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, UK, Latvia, Luxembourg, Ukraine, Thailand, South Korea, Israel, Japan, Estonia, China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan), also made the list, set to take effect from May 15.Turkey yesterday [May 2] recorded nearly 26,000 new Covid-19 cases, taking the total number of Covid-19 infections in the country to around 4.9 million cases. The number of the pandemic-related death in the past 24 hours expanded by 340 to a total of 40,844.The country has started its vaccination program since January 14 after approving emergency use for Chinese CoronaVac vaccine. So far, over 13.8 million Turkish has been administered with the vaccine.As of May 3, Vietnam has confirmed 2,962 infections, including 2,549 convalescents. Half of the total cases are locally-transmitted.Source: VNA/VNS/VOV/VIR/SGT/Nhan Dan/Hanoitimes";vietnamnet.vn;6906;news;VN;en;['Vietnamnet News'];https://vnn-imgs-f.vgcloud.vn/2021/03/03/11/vietnam-news-headlines-march-3.jpg;False;;6.4115157;2303f46ff22c551fd55b0c79ecf1cb55;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 3}
202;Is China exporting surveillance under the guise of 'smart city'?;Dr. Chester B. Cabalza;2023-03-12 16:01:00;timezone unknown;https://www.manilatimes.net/2023/03/13/opinion/columns/is-china-exporting-surveillance-under-the-guise-of-smart-city/1882447;manilatimes.net;CHINA is one of the leading countries in 'smart city' initiatives.;"CHINA is one of the leading countries in ""smart city"" initiatives. Chinese companies are involved in more than half of the world's smart city initiatives. These companies, with the expertise of developing new cities and urban technologies at home, are expanding their businesses abroad.
As their aspirations align with the development interests of the emerging economy of various countries, Chinese firms are emerging as crucial players in development planning. For instance, in Southeast Asia, Chinese firms play significant roles in many existing or planned built-from-scratch smart cities. Beijing's launch of the Belt and Road Initiative, and its ""Digital Silk Road"" component, provide high-level support for Chinese companies' participation.
It is tempting for emerging markets in Southeast Asia to forge a consensual approach with China's technology investment firms despite its proneness to threats in the purview of national security.
 
Disadvantages and concerns
Becoming ""smart"" means harnessing data to optimize city functions — from more efficient use of utilities and other services to reducing traffic congestion and pollution — all to empower public authorities and citizens.
 
The digital silk road initiative is an attempt to modernize and strengthen the digital economy of Southeast Asia through increased connectivity in telecommunications, the internet of things, artificial intelligence and robotics. But it also has ill effects on the borderless digital cloud since China has control of the sources of digital engines and technologies. What's more, the disadvantages may soon outweigh the supposed advantages.
There are concerns about how supercharged surveillance is encroaching on free speech, privacy and data protection. But the truth is that facial recognition and related technologies are far from the most worrisome features of smart cities.
Part of what supposedly makes cities smarter is the deployment and integration of surveillance technologies such as sensors and biometric data collection systems. Electronic, infrared, thermal and lidar sensors form the basis of the smart grid, and they do everything from operating streetlights to optimizing parking and traffic flow to detecting crime.
Shanghai has installed Alibaba's City Brain public surveillance system, which oversees over 1,100 biometric facial recognition cameras. A combination of satellites, drones and fixed cameras grab over 20 million images a day. The bus, metro and credit cards of residents are also traced in real-time. These surveillance tools are spreading. Chinese firms are busy exporting surveillance tech to Latin America, other parts of Asia, and Africa, helping enable what some critics call digital authoritarianism.
 
But a narrow preoccupation with surveillance technologies, as disconcerting as they are, underestimates the threats on the near horizon. Smart cities are themselves a potential liability — for entirely different reasons. This is because many of them are approaching the precipice of a hyperconnected ""internet of everything,"" which comes with unprecedented levels of risk tied to billions of unsecured devices.


These don't just include real-time surveillance devices, such as satellites, drones and closed-circuit cameras. By 2025, there could be over 75 billion connected devices around the world, many of them lack even the most rudimentary security features. As cities become ever more connected, the risks of digital harm by malign actors grow exponentially.
The partner countries involved in the project would not only allow China to monitor huge volumes of data on their citizens but also on those from other countries, who are on personal or business trips. They will also be helping China to become a global leader in exporting its authoritarian surveillance technology to other like-minded regimes.
Accessing data
 
The Chinese government is equipped with laws, which enable it to access data from any device. The Chinese companies make available all their customer data to the government for inclusion in the Social Credit score. Moreover, Chinese companies and nationals also participate in the country's espionage project. So, anyone connected to the BRI is part of the Chinese national surveillance project.
China is probably one of the best real-world examples of how a politician can use a ""dictatorship in a box"" solution to get and maintain political success.
China has AI tools embedded in those technologies, which poses threat to society and has implications for the host countries. The sophistication of AI tools built-in with those technologies can bring two consequences.
 
It could lead to addiction and tech support to win the hearts and minds of Southeast Asians or it could lead to further digital destruction igniting copyright issues, and ethical considerations for infringement and espionage.
Security risks
Australia's decision to remove cameras in sensitive and critical technologies from China is considerable since it breaches wider threats to national security. Australia's foreign ministry followed the lead of the country's defense ministry, deciding to remove all Chinese-made surveillance cameras from its facilities following reports that the technology posed a security risk.
This followed Defense Minister Richard Marles' statement that he had ordered Chinese-made security cameras stripped from defense sites following an audit that revealed at least 913 such cameras had been installed across more than 250 Australian government buildings.
The United States has already banned several Chinese vendors and surveillance products, and the United Kingdom last November informed government departments to cease installing Chinese-linked surveillance cameras at sensitive buildings, citing security risks.
China is installing over 500 surveillance cameras in Gwadar city of Pakistan, fueling speculations that it was never meant to be a port for trade. It is built like a naval base.
Meanwhile, the ex-CM of Balochistan has revealed that many people are being forcibly shifted from Gwadar to accommodate a fenced community project for Chinese companies.
Studies show that smart city implications will be a threat to maritime security. Espionage will be prevalent just like the latest spying balloon saga where China released information that the big white balloon was used for meteoric weather forecasting. But cognitive warfare brought deception that is imminent to the armed forces. As power rivalry rises, we will see more manifestations of irregular warfare.
While technologies can disrupt operations, they can also destroy carriers, submarines, vessels and warships using digital configurations. The connecting dots are eminent in the domino effects of the digital economy on maritime trade and aerial operations.
Identity theft, unlawful data gathering, and sharing, phishing and espionage may become prevalent if not cautiously investigated and monitored using the doubted cyber and technological initiatives and efforts of China.
There are fiber optics and electronics that can copy or transmit information without the knowledge of the proprietors and users.
There are lurking dangers in the use of language and specs of digital technologies in favor of Chinese inventors and makers of technologies. It may be cheaper and affordable to make it more marketable and reachable, but the tech trap imposes a lot of dangers and threats. In China's attempt to be digitally inclusive, it must perform transparency to make no excuse for information and technology thefts.

203;China, Kyrgyzstan fortify bilateral ties;Xinhua News Agency;2022-07-31 16:22:00;timezone unknown;https://www.manilatimes.net/2022/08/01/news/world/china-kyrgyzstan-fortify-bilateral-ties/1852940;manilatimes.net;CHOLPON-ATA, Kyrgyzstan: Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday held talks with Kyrgyz Foreign Minister Jeenbek Kulubaev here over further strengthening...;"CHOLPON-ATA, Kyrgyzstan: Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday held talks with Kyrgyz Foreign Minister Jeenbek Kulubaev here over further strengthening relations between the two countries.This year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Kyrgyzstan, which is of great significance to linking the past and the future, said Wang.Over the past 30 years, China-Kyrgyzstan relations have withstood various risks and challenges, their traditional friendship has grown stronger and their practical cooperation has yielded fruitful results, which bring important benefits to people of the two countries, said Wang.In particular, the two sides have always stood firm together on major issues concerning each other's core interests, which has consolidated the political foundation of bilateral relations, enhanced mutual trust and fully demonstrated the substance of the comprehensive strategic partnership, he said, noting that the two countries have become veritable good neighbors, good friends, good partners and good brothers. Wang said that China has always regarded Kyrgyzstan as an important partner in its neighborhood diplomacy, will as always firmly support measures taken by Kyrgyzstan to safeguard national sovereignty, security and social stability, and firmly oppose external interference in Kyrgyzstan's internal affairs.China is ready to work with Kyrgyzstan to follow the important consensus reached at the successful meeting between the two countries' heads of state this year, take the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties as an opportunity, and the Belt and Road cooperation as the main line, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, carry forward traditional friendship, and push the China-Kyrgyzstan comprehensive strategic partnership to a new level with the aim of building a China-Kyrgyzstan community with a shared future, said the Chinese foreign minister. For his part, Kulubaev said that since the establishment of diplomatic ties 30 years ago, Kyrgyzstan and China have carried out high-level cooperation, elevated bilateral relations to the comprehensive strategic partnership, consolidated good-neighborly friendship and laid a solid foundation for deepening mutually beneficial cooperation.The two sides have worked together to implement the important consensus reached by the two countries' heads of state and achieved solid results, Kulubaev said.Kyrgyzstan regards relations with China as a diplomatic priority and firmly supports China's legitimate position on all key China-related issues. No political differences can hinder all-round cooperation between Kyrgyzstan and China, he said, adding that the Kyrgyz side fully supports building a Kyrgyzstan-China community with a shared future.Kurubayev said Kyrgyzstan looks forward to accelerating the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project, welcomes Chinese experts to visit Kyrgyzstan to carry out survey work, and is ready to work with China to speed up implementation of key projects such as the new North-South Highway and the renovation of Bishkek's municipal road network. The Kyrgyz side hopes to simplify customs clearance procedures at ports between the two sides, and increase flights between the two countries so that more Kyrgyz students can return to China to resume their studies.
He thanked the Chinese side for setting up the Luban Workshop in Kyrgyzstan, and welcomed Chinese enterprises to invest and launch business in Kyrgyzstan and help Kyrgyzstan build an e-commerce logistics center in Central Asia.Wang noted that during the trip, the Chinese side has felt the great importance and ardent expectations attached by Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan to the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project and will jointly accelerate the promotion of this important project.This year, China-Kyrgyzstan economic and trade exchanges have bucked the trend and exceeded the pre-pandemic level, said Wang, noting that the Chinese side is willing to import more green and high-quality agricultural and livestock products from Kyrgyzstan. Both sides should steadily advance practical cooperation, create new cooperation highlights such as new energy, ecological agriculture, e-commerce and cross-border logistics, and jointly build a ""green Silk Road"" and a ""digital Silk Road,"" Wang added.The Chinese side is willing to increase the frequency of direct flights in an orderly manner, further improve the efficiency of cargo transit at ports, provide convenience for Kyrgyz students to return to China and resume their studies, promote the construction of the Luban Workshop and expand medical and health cooperation between the two countries, according to Wang.The two sides expressed satisfaction with the efficient cooperation between China and Kyrgyzstan in international and regional affairs. Kulubaev said that the Kyrgyz side spoke highly of the important concept of building a community with a shared future for mankind put forward by President Xi Jinping, agreed to build a community with a shared future for neighboring countries, highly appreciate and are willing to take an active part in the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative.The two sides exchanged views on strengthening the cooperation mechanism between China and the five Central Asian countries and agreed to promote cooperation in priority areas such as transportation, economy and trade, investment, industry, agriculture, energy, customs and culture, so as to build an all-round, multi-tiered and multi-dimensional sub-regional cooperation pattern.Following the talks, the two foreign ministers jointly met the press.";manilatimes.net;7400;business;PH;en;Xinhua News Agency;https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2022/07/31/93915.jpeg;False;;20.835869;3bc68b902941450e8064cd8e7bfb57bd;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 3}

It was no big surprise. For nearly a decade already, China has been the largest trading partner of the Asean region and a few years after the Asean was the leading trading partner of China. The Philippines in this respect has thus actually been a late bloomer. (Blame the enduring stranglehold of American colonization on the Philippine economy?)How this all came about may be traced largely to Asean and China entering into the Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Economic Cooperation, which resulted in the Asean-China Free Trade Area rolling out in 2010. Trade between them expanded rapidly as tariffs were lowered and investments liberalized between them.The logic of propinquity is writ large in this development. China is the Philippines' nearest neighbor to the north. The direct flights now available between the two countries' capitals, Manila and Beijing, bear this out. I barely had the time between takeoff and landing procedures to take a good nap the last time I went to Beijing. This is incredible when one recalls the time the traveler had no choice but to stop over in Hong Kong, and from there, take a small plane or a slow bus to the mainland. China then was truly faraway. Well, not anymore. The closeness of trade between China and the Philippines would be no surprise for another reason: Trade between the Philippines and China has very ancient historical roots. Archeologists and historians believe in a Maritime Jade Road trading in jade and spices springing up in Taiwan and the Philippines from 2000 BCE to 1000 CE and reaching parts of Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and other areas in Southeast Asia.The Philippines stood at the gateway of the Maritime Silk Route, which connected Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, Arabian Peninsula, Somalia, Egypt and Europe. It began at the same time as the overland Silk Route in 2nd century BCE stretching from Asia to the Mediterranean traversing China, India, Persia, Arabia, Greece and Italy. The Maritime Silk Route lasted longer, by a century, as traders abandoned the overland Silk Route because of the frequency of their being attacked by bandits of various nationalities. There were Chinese (Japanese, too) in the South China Sea like Limahong but they seemed a lot fewer than the bandits on the overland Silk Route! Evidence abounds that the Philippines was part of the Maritime Silk Route in the form of the Chinese ceramics from different dynasties unearthed by excavations all over the Philippines. The Chinese exchanged ceramics besides the proverbial silk and colored beads, while the Filipinos traded hemp cloth, tortoise shells, pearls and yellow wax.The Martime Silk Route was replaced in the subsequent age by European colonialism in Asia with the galleon trade, which from the 115th to latter part of the 119th century brought goods from China and the Philippines and Southeast Asia to the Americas and Europe in exchange for silver money minted in Mexico. For some strange reason, the galleon trade ended when Mexico became independent from Spain.Enter the United States by pretending to be an ally of the Philippine Revolution against Spain but turning out to be a colonizer and occupier. Faraway United States remained the top trading partner of the Philippines even after independence because of heavy American investments in the Philippines and by such devices as Parity Rights.So much for that rear view of the trade between China and the Philippines. Let's look at now and ahead. It is no time yet to celebrate China's becoming the Philippines' leading trading partner. It may only be a considered just a beginning of sorts. China-Philippines trade can only rise to greater heights because it is quite low in total volume when compared to the leading trading partners of China among the Asean countries. Two-way trade of the Philippines with China in 2021 was a meager $38.35 billion compared to the total volume of $165 billion of the top Asean trading partner of China, Vietnam. Trailing behind the latter country were Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore. Those four countries alone accounted for 74.7 percent of trade between China and Asean. The Philippine government is counting on the export of digital monolithic integrated circuits and semiconductor devices in the electronics and electrical sector, which accounted for majority of exports last year, to push trade with China further upward. These along with metals, motor vehicles and parts, coconut and its by-products, luxury items and tourism education, and creative services.
Also tagged for the big push are fruits. The two countries' being the nearest neighbors makes trade in perishable goods a worthwhile activity. A considerable encouraging factor was their being part of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, now the biggest trading bloc in the world, whose other members include the Asean countries. The partnership stipulates that customs clearance of perishable goods should basically be completed in less than six hours.In recent years, the Philippines successfully pushed avocadoes to join bananas, pineapples and mangoes as top perishable exports to China. Promising to be the next Philippine fruit to conquer the Chinese market is durian. A group of inspectors from China came early last year and found Philippine durian of high quality and good taste. Reception by the Chinese of the first batch of imports from Davao City later last year was more than enthusiastic. From what I gather from my friends in Beijing, the Chinese fully expect the Philippines to join the other countries in Southeast Asia as big exporters of this King of Fruits.China has for sometime now been the biggest importer of durian in the world. 2021 was a boom year for durian, with imports rising year on year by 427 percent to 821,000 tons worth $4.205 billion. Trust the Chinese culinary inventiveness to find various ways of enjoying the fruit apart from its natural, creamy state, taste and texture: as durian cake, durian milk crepes, durian pizza, durian hot pot, etc. While I had my first taste of durian in Manila and Davao, I developed a love, nay a passion for it in Laos where I had my first ambassadorial posting. It grows almost wildly in that country. Neighbors would gift you with their surplus produce. The tree would grow and ripen on the branch so plentifully that they harvested more than they could consume. Like all edible things grown in Laos' extremely fertile, red soil, the durian in Laos is extra-sweet and addictive.Coming back on recall to Manila, I found this newly-found passion difficult to satisfy. One finds durian rarely and long and in-between in the markets in Manila and he finds it only at the high-end markets at high-end prices.Some people explain this rarity of durian in Manila for its pungent smell. I find this theory as sheer sour-graping to hide their inability to afford the fruit. The last time I found and bought a durian fruit, spikes, and all, I paid P800, way above the daily minimum wage in Manila. I have never minded, much more, been offended by the smell of durian. I simply thought it providential that durian should have a strong smell like other fruits with strong smells, e.g., mabolo and cheza. Actually there are many varieties of durian, some with flowery, pleasant smells and others with no smell at all. The more reasonable explanation is the fact that while durian grows in at least 47 provinces in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao, more than 90 percent of the supply come from Davao, and much of this probably stays in Davao. The folks there eat durian, with some freshly-boiled rice, as main dish. If under contracts with the Chinese, all the produce in Davao were exported to China, what would happen to the durian lovers of Manila?That is why I have greeted the news about durian in China with mixed emotions. I remember what happened to the mango after it became a Philippine brand export to Japan and other places. Mangoes became more expensive than apples and the mangoes one finds in the local markets are the rejects of the quality-control procedures required of exporters, fruits with one dark tiny spot or two.On the other hand, the export of the fruit would, of course, mean additional income for some of the poorest localities in the country. The silver lining in the exports abroad of favorite fruits is that demand abroad forces increased local production of the fruit. Mangoes were grown in more places and they became available not only at the height of summer but all year round. New uses for the mango were found. Juice was made from it, even if still unripe or green. Mangoes not passing export quality control are dried in the sun and sold as snacks and by themselves are exported. I hope the same will happen to durian. Why can't it be grown outside Davao? Why can't we eat durian all day? As main dish at breakfast, lunch and supper, and durian sandwiches and durian ice cream mid-morning and mid-afternoon?";manilatimes.net;7400;science;PH;en;Jaime J.

This article is all about China.
As the world was Europeanized in the 19th century and Americanized in the 20th century, it is being Asianized in the 21st century. Global leaders acknowledged that the Asian Century is set to begin (Financial Times, 2019) and there is no turning back (WEF) and there are reasons to be optimistic (Nikkei). Asia's rise has been swift. Looking ahead, Asia is expected to rebound faster, post-pandemic (IMF). The region is home to 21 of the world's 30 largest, and four of the 10 most visited countries.
Home to more than half of the world's population, the region has climbed from low- to middle-income status within a single generation. By 2040, it is likely to generate more than 50 percent of world GDP, and could account for nearly 40 percent of global consumption.
 
China in numbers
Central to the Asian Century is China. Forty years of economic growth, at an average of nearly 10 percent a year, has transformed the country into a global leader in technology and manufacturing. China is home to six of the world's megacities, and its economy is now second only in size to the United States — larger if trade is taken into account. Life expectancy has risen to 75 for men and 78 for women (WHO), with a mean age of 38.4 for a population of 1.41 billion.
 
China's consumer spending is about $6 trillion per year (2020) and it has everything for the world. Over 35 percent of the global luxury goods spend comes from China. It is also a major contributor to the global tourism industry, with about $250 billion spent internationally.
China is a world leader in renewable energy. China is home to over 400 electric vehicle companies and leading consumer and manufacturer of the solar power industry with three of the world's five largest floating solar plants. China accounts for more than half of global electric car sales.
Pioneering China
Many of the things we use in our daily lives were pioneered by the Chinese. From the paper (105 BCE) to the printing press (960–1127) to bristle toothbrush (1498) to kites (1232) and umbrellas inspired by lotus leaves in ancient China. China's dominant silk market today dates back during the Neolithic period. The earliest porcelain emerged in the Shang Dynasty (1600–1046 BCE), matured during the Tang Dynasty (618-906) and improved during the Song Dynasty (960–1279).
 
Ancient Chinese medicine is known for preventive medicine through food and medicine homology wherein food is the medicine and medicines are food. They have already standardized the unit of measure for medicine. Tea was discovered in ancient China by the Chinese emperor Shennong (2737 BC). Alcohol is known as Jiu in Chinese and is often used as a spiritual offering in ancient China (1000 years before Arabian). Beer was widely consumed in ancient China.




















 


The decimal system was a Chinese contribution to mathematical advances (Han dynasty). The earliest binary thought (straight line and broken line) originated in China (2000 BC). The ancient Chinese began to use the decimal counting method with the use of the abacus, which is the first calculator known to humans — and the root of digitalization.
Chang Heng who developed the seismograph, envisaged that the earth is a sphere with nine continents and introduced the crisscrossing grid of latitude and longitude. The compass was invented by the Chinese (2nd century BC) initially for feng shui but became the navigational compass (1000 AD). The mechanical clock was invented by Yi Xing, a Buddhist monk (725 A.D) and later developed by the inventor Su Song to a more sophisticated clock called the Cosmic Empire in 1092.
 
A pinewood impregnated with sulfur started the match in China (577 CE). Gunpowder was invented by a Chinese Taoist alchemist (1000 AD). The Wei State already used torches attached to arrows to guard against the invading troops (228 A.D). Later, the Song Dynasty (960-1279) adapted gunpowder to make rockets which were widely used in military and entertainment activities in China.
The Silk Road refers to a network of routes used by traders for more than 1,500 years, from when the Han dynasty opened trade in 130 BC until 1453 CE, when the Ottoman Empire closed off trade with the West. Ferdinand von Richthofen first used the term ""silk road"" (1877 CE) to describe the well-traveled pathway of goods between Europe and East Asia.
The Great Wall of China was built by the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang (260–210 BC) to protect the country from northern invaders. The 5,500-mile-long wall was built by slaves, criminals and peasants. It is estimated that millions of people worked to build the Great Wall over a period of 1,000 years.
 
An Iron Age began in ancient China during the Zhou dynasty (1050 BC–256 BC). Wheelbarrows were used in China earlier than in Europe (11th century). The helicopter rotor and the propeller of the helicopter top, called the ""bamboo dragonfly"" originated in China. Sir George Cayley, the father of modern aeronautics, studied the Chinese helicopter top in 1809. Recently, China's Space Science has landed a space rover Chang'e-4 on the far side of the Moon.
The first online shopping platform Alibaba (1999) is followed by a fintech solution Alipay (2015). WeChat productively fuses the worlds of social and commercial technology (2019). TikTok originated in China and has invaded social media, including the US.
Intelligent and harmonizing China
China ranks as the fifth country with the highest IQ in the world with an average IQ of 104.1. China's innovation score is among the highest in the world, lagging only Germany, the US and Switzerland.
China's education system is highly competitive, with students facing intense pressure to perform academically, which has led to a culture of diligence, persistence and academic excellence. Confucianism was at the center of education in China from the Han Dynasty (221–206 BC). The basic ideas of Confucius still play a role in Chinese education today. Confucius divided the aims of teaching into individual and social aims. The ""small tranquility"" is the first stage of society and the ""great harmony"" is set as the highest stage of ideal society. The substance of teaching includes moral, intellectual and religious teaching. Social harmony is paramount.
Even Sun Tzu, the Chinese military general and strategist (771-256 BC) summarized the sublime victory in the Art of War as winning the war without fighting.
Chinese logograph is the only surviving lexigraphic language in the world and is unique. The Chinese characters embody everything — philosophy, history, norms, arts — are all inside the character. The etymology of a character can be seen in the character itself.
Now, imagine the world without China.

XINHUA PHOTO BEIJING: Amid the weakening of global consensus on opening up, President Xi Jinping made fresh pledges on Thursday to open the Chinese market wider as the country has fully delivered on its accession commitments to the World Trade Organization (WTO).Noting that globalization is facing headwinds, Xi expressed concern over the decline of an index on world openness in the past decade while addressing the opening ceremony of the 4th China International Import Expo (CIIE). ""We must stay on top of the prevailing trend of economic globalization and support countries around the world in opening up wider while rejecting unilateralism and protectionism. This is significantly important if we are to take humanity to a better future,"" Xi said.New pledges ""Opening up is the hallmark of contemporary China,"" Xi told officials, business leaders and entrepreneurs participating in this year's CIIE.As part of the country's efforts to safeguard true multilateralism, Xi said China will uphold the position of the multilateral trading regime as the main channel for international rules-setting and safeguard the stability of global industrial and supply chains. China will also take an active and open attitude in negotiations on issues such as the digital economy, trade and the environment, industrial subsidies and state-owned enterprises, he said.With a population of 1.4 billion and over 400 million middle-incomers, China will share market opportunities with the rest of the world via measures such as opening more demonstration zones for creative promotion of import trade and promoting Silk Road e-commerce, Xi said. To firmly promote high-standard opening up, China will further shorten the negative list for foreign investment and expand the opening of telecommunication, health care and other services in an orderly fashion, according to the president.
""China will firmly uphold the common interests of the world,"" he said, pledging to actively join in global efforts to tackle climate change and safeguard food and energy security, and provide more assistance to fellow developing countries within the framework of South-South cooperation.Unchanged resolveThe year of 2021 marks the 20th anniversary of China's accession to the WTO. Over the last two decades, the country's continuous efforts in widening opening-up have brought its development to a new stage and injected fresh impetus into the world economy, Xi noted. ""China has fully delivered on its accession commitments,"" Xi said.China's overall tariff rate has been cut from 15.3 percent to 7.4 percent, lower than the 9.8-percent accession commitment, delivering dividends to its trade partners all over the world.In the past 20 years, China's global ranking of trade in goods has risen from the sixth to the first while that of its trade in services has jumped from the 11th to the second. The country's development and progress since it entered the WTO is the result of much hard work and great tenacity of the Chinese people under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China and the country's proactive steps to strengthen international cooperation and work for win-win outcomes, Xi said.""As for China, we will not change our resolve to open wider at a high standard; we will not change our determination to share development opportunities with the rest of the world; and we will not change our commitment to an economic globalization that is more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all,"" Xi said.As the world's first import-themed national-level expo, China's CIIE has offered a platform for entrepreneurs and traders worldwide. This year's CIIE draws nearly 3,000 businesses from 127 countries and regions, higher than its last edition.""As a European company in China for over 30 years, we have witnessed China's continuous efforts to deepen opening up and improve the business environment since its accession to the WTO.

As one of the longest-running broadsheets in this country, The Manila Times has witnessed the development of the relations between the Philippines and its neighbors over the century and has played a positive role in enhancing communication and exchanges between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), including the Philippines.This year marks the 30th anniversary of China-Asean dialogue relations, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is expected to take effect soon. This forum is highly relevant as it seeks to answer the calls of our time. On behalf of the Chinese embassy in the Philippines, I would like to thank The Manila Times for the efforts in putting this meeting together. I look forward to our discussion on China-Asean cooperation and the RCEP's potential for common development into the future. Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian. SCREENGRAB FROM FACEBOOK LIVE As the previous Chinese ambassador to Asean and the current ambassador to the Philippines, I had the honor to witness and facilitate the development of China-Asean mutually beneficial cooperation as good neighbors, and also the concerted efforts of China and the Philippines to promote and benefit from China-Asean relations.By leaps and bounds Over the past three decades, China-Asean relations have developed by leaps and bounds. Among the Asean dialogue partners, China has created a number of ""firsts"": the first to join the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, the first to establish a strategic partnership with Asean, the first to discuss with Asean to establish a free trade zone, the first to express clear support of the Asean's centrality in the regional cooperation, and the first to express its willingness publicly to sign the Protocol to the Treaty on the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapons-free Zone. Our merchandise trade has skyrocketed 85 times since we established dialogue relations. The personnel exchanges exceeded 65 million in 2019. We have formed more than 200 pairs of sister cities. Through our joint efforts, China and Asean have become the largest trading partners, the most connotative partners, and the most dynamic strategic partners, and have served as an important pillar for peace, stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific.After Covid-19 struck, our two sides have extended each other a helping hand and worked together to safeguard our pragmatic cooperation. China and many Asean countries have established fast tracks and green lanes to facilitate the movement of personnel and goods and stabilize regional industrial and supply chains. Against the backdrop of shrinking world trade, China-Asean trade and investment have bucked the trend and risen to a higher level in both scale and quality, providing strong support to regional economic recovery, as well as enriching and invigorating China-Asean community with a shared future. Our bilateral trade reached a milestone in history. In 2020, China-Asean trade in goods reached $684.6 billion. Asean surpassed the EU to become China's largest trading partner for the first time in history. China has been Asean's largest trading partner for the past 12 years in a row. In the first half of 2021, China-Asean trade totaled $410.75 billion, up by 38.2 percent year on year and accounting for 14.7 percent of China's total foreign trade. China's exports to Asean reached $225.83 billion, up by 38.3 percent, and imports from Asean reached $184.92 billion, up by 38.1 percent.Our two-way investment was booming. In 2020, China's direct investment in Asean reached $14.36 billion, up by 52.1 percent, and Asean's actual investment in China reached $7.95 billion, up by 1 percent. According to preliminary statistics, in the first half of 2021, Chinese enterprises invested $6.81 billion in Asean, and the bloc's actual investment in China was $5.63 billion. As of June this year, accumulated mutual investment between China and Asean exceeded $310 billion, with cooperation booming in sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, infrastructure, high tech, the digital economy, and the green economy. As our Belt and Road cooperation has continued to make headway, a number of major infrastructure projects have pressed ahead with growing regional connectivity. Our regional economic integration further deepened. With the potential and dividend of China-Asean Free Trade agreement and the upgrading protocol being unleashed, Lancang-Mekong cooperation and China-BIMP-EAGA cooperation have been deepened and substantiated. Thanks to the China-Asean Free Trade Area, which was fully established more than decade ago, 90 percent of our goods could be traded at zero tariff. We doubled our efforts along with other participating countries to sign RCEP in November last year, marking a new milestone in regional economic integration.Constructive role of PHThe progress of China-Asean relations and fruitful cooperation could not have been achieved without the joint efforts of Asean member states. Among which, the Philippines has worked closely with China and other parties and played a constructive role in advancing the relations between China and Asean throughout its three-year coordinatorship. Meanwhile, benefiting from the development of China-Asean relations, and under the guidance of President Xi Jinping and President Duterte, China and the Philippines have upgraded our ties to comprehensive strategic cooperation. China has become the largest trading partner, the second largest foreign investor, and the second largest source of foreign tourists of the Philippines. The synergies between the Belt and Road initiative and the Build, Build, Build program have strengthened, and our economic and trade cooperation has seen a stronger momentum.China-Asean dialogue relations are standing at a new starting point in the year of the 30th anniversary, and we need to answer to the new requirements of building on past achievements and forging ahead into the future at a higher level. We are currently in a world experiencing changes and a pandemic both unseen in a century, and the pandemic has added momentum to the impacts of the recent increase in protectionism on global industrial and supply chains. The instability and uncertainty facing China-Asean economic and trade cooperation are clearly on the rise.Crisis breeds opportunities, and changes could herald new prospects. The greater the challenges we face, the greater the need for solidarity. We need to take initiatives cohesively and seek new opportunities through tiding over crisis. During the course of China-Asean relations over the years, we have always stood together with mutual support and cooperation, each crisis has led to closer ties and stronger cooperation between us.The crucial and timely signing of RCEP, through our joint efforts of overcoming the challenge of pandemic with other members, is yet another telling example. As the first non-Asean participating country after Singapore to formally complete the approval process of RCEP, China has made full preparations for fulfilling its obligations under the agreement. Also, it's gratifying that all member countries of RCEP have expressed their resolve to ratify the agreement before the end of this year and push for its entry into force by Jan. 1, 2022. It is said that the agreement was ratified by the Philippine government earlier this month and is under deliberation at the parliamentary level. We will work with the Philippines and other member states to expedite their ratification processes for entry into force and implementation of the agreement as scheduled.Under the framework of RCEP, a free trade area featuring the largest population, broadest commercial scale and greatest development potential would be established, covering roughly 30 percent of the world's GDP, trade and population. Here comes the question: How to realize the potential of RCEP?RCEP potentialFirst of all, we expect the RCEP to open a new chapter for China-Asean economic and trade ties. Once the agreement is implemented, China-Asean could further optimize their resource and market advantages through deep integration with the capital and technological advantages of other RCEP members on a larger scale and at a higher level. Thus, RCEP could lead to more promising prospects of our economic and trade cooperation and promote the post-Covid-19 economic recovery of China and Asean.Second, we expect the RCEP to add new vitality to East Asia economic integration. The agreement integrates and optimizes the region's economic and trade rules in a wide range of fields, including goods, services, investment, intellectual property rights, e-commerce and competition policy, which will further promote the integrated development of industrial chain, supply chain and value chain in the region. Hence the RCEP is expected to become a major platform for economic and trade cooperation in East Asia.Third, we expect the RCEP to inject new impetus into promoting an open global economic and trade system, and to serve as leading drivers for maintaining free trade, multilateralism, and international cooperation.Finally, we expect the RCEP to bring tangible new opportunities to the business community in this region, especially to create favorable conditions for those small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) so that they could better participate in regional economic and trade cooperation and tap into markets in various countries by enjoying policy dividends of this agreement.On top of that, the pandemic has inspired a surge in emerging industries and new businesses. Among which, the significance of the digital economy is highlighted. Last year was designated the China-Asean Year of Digital Economy Cooperation. China is leading in the development of digital economy, and Asean has seen its digital economy industry booming in recent years. The two sides are likely to see the combined value of their digital economies reach $9.58 trillion by 2025. We should work together to seize the opportunities and intensify cooperation on digital technologies in epidemic prevention and control, digital infrastructure development, e-commerce, smart city, and other areas, so as to nurture new drivers for our economic and trade cooperation, advance digital connectivity and build a digital Silk Road.The darkest hour will pass. Looking ahead, we can see light and hope. I believe with our concerted efforts, we will win a full victory against the virus and see a full recovery of our economies at an early date. Looking ahead, with sustaining highly complementary advantages for development and deeply integrated industrial and supply chains, China-Asean economic and trade cooperation is expected to have enormous space for further development in the post-pandemic era. China is ready to match Asean's economic recovery measures, including the Asean Comprehensive Recovery Framework. China will also work together with Asean to further enhance regional connectivity, create more dividends of the upgraded China-Asean Free Trade Area and promote the early entry into force of RCEP. Efforts will also be made to develop new cooperation areas such as digital economy and strengthen cooperation for sustainable development. Let's step up our efforts to deepen our pragmatic cooperation, lay a solid foundation for the building of a China-Asean community with a shared future, and deliver more benefits to people in the region.";manilatimes.net;7400;economics;PH;en;['Chinese Ambassador Huang Xilian'];https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2021/09/17/16413.jpg;True;;17.059607;11d930cfbd8c91027b7fc8e0378e0017;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND China', 'lang': 'en', 'countries': 'MY,PH,ID,VN,TH,LA,KH,MM,SG,BN,TL', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'sort_by': 'rank', 'from': '3 years ago', 'page': 3}
208;'Countering' China would pave the way for global depression;Dan Steinbock;2022-09-11 16:06:59;full;https://www.manilatimes.net/2022/09/12/opinion/columns/countering-china-would-pave-the-way-for-global-depression/1858160;manilatimes.net;In its pursuit of unipolar primacy, the Biden administration is risking the economic stability of China, the West, emerging Asia and the futures of the Global South, including the...;"In its pursuit of unipolar primacy, the Biden administration is risking the economic stability of China, the West, emerging Asia and the futures of the Global South, including the Philippines.BEFORE the global pandemic, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported China had replaced the United States as the engine of the global economy. In parallel, Reuters market analyst Jack Kemp warned that since early 2018, ""the United States has pursued a deliberate policy of attempting to hurt China's economy in response to concerns about the shifting balance of economic power and unfair trade practices.""As economist Anne O. Krueger saw it, Trump's trade war was ""a failure that harmed both China and the US."" Many hoped that Biden's victory would come with a bilateral reset. But the reverse happened. Building on Trump's flawed policies, the Biden White House began to weaponize those policies while diversifying risks to US allies from the EU and Japan to Ukraine and Taiwan — and the Philippines. This purposeful effort to force American primacy in the 21st century, when it is no longer supported by fundamentals, has potential not only to push the world economy into a stagflationary recession, but into a severe global depression.This is also why Malaysia's former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad last week blamed Washington for ratcheting up tensions in the region. Mahathir urged the Asean members to shun divide-and-rule geopolitics, and to focus on economic development in cooperation with China. How China replaced USUntil the 1990s, poor economies had been dependent mainly on the West. After centuries of devastating colonialism, the divergence between the two had only deepened in the postwar era, due to the inherently unequal exchange.By the early 2010s, China's growth impact on the low- and middle-income countries had increased significantly, as the OECD then reported. Meanwhile, the impact of the OECD economies had significantly decreased for low-income economies and stagnated for middle-income countries.These trends intensified with the rise of Chinese investment abroad and the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013, which has boosted modernization in many emerging and developing economies. Before the Trump trade wars, China replaced the US as the engine of the world economy. Between 2013 and 2018, it accounted for 28 percent of all growth worldwide on average. The IMF data suggested that China would account for a similar share of growth over the next five years. Most importantly, China was pulling along many of the world's middle- and smaller-size economies in its train.
Today, this great project is threatened. By turning its frictions with China into still another unwarranted Cold War, the Biden administration is pushing the world economy at the edge of the abyss. It's time to quantify the magnitude of these risks.The $25T global riskChina's rise as a global growth engine is reflected by the expansion of its economy relative to other major global growth engines: the United States, the largest European economies (Germany, France, the UK and Italy), and Japan. In terms of market exchange rates, China passed Japan as a global growth engine around 2010, Europe-4 in the mid-2010s, and is positioned to surpass the US at the end of the 2020s (see figure 1a). However, the purchasing power scenario is useful to illustrate secular trends. As the relative shares of the US, Europe-4 and Japan continue to decline in the world economy, that of China has potential to rise (see figure 1b). FIGURE 1. CHINA AS GLOBAL GROWTH ENGINE Source: IMF/WEO Database; Difference Group At the end of 2022, China is likely to account for $20 trillion or about a fifth of the estimated $104 trillion world economy. These trillions of dollars are not just China's gain, or the advantage of rich economies that benefit from the mainland's expansion. They offer critical support to middle- and low-income countries that the West's colonialism derailed into longstanding dependency. Due to these global inter-dependencies, any effort to destabilize China has the potential to undermine living standards in the West for decades, while turning the world's most fragile economies into failed states.$6.1 trillion risk to world tradeThe role of global growth engines is reflected by trade and investment, and the countries these pillar economies partner with. Two-thirds of China's exports goes to a handful of major economies in North America (US, Mexico), Western Europe (Germany, the Netherlands, the UK), East Asia (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan), Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand), Russia and Australia.Yet, the real impact of Chinese exports is far greater. Even if small- and medium-size economies import less in absolute terms, they often import significantly in relative terms, as evidenced by China's 100 export partners. In 2021, the total value exported by China amounted to almost $3.4 trillion (see figure 2a). Conversely, that year the total value imported by China soared to almost $2.7 trillion (see figure 2b).FIGURE 2. CHINA'S TRADING PARTNERS WORLDWIDEA. CHINA EXP PARTNERS Countering-China2 B. CHINA IMP PARTNERS Source: Data for 2021, ITC, Aug. 2022 For decades, Chinese imports and cheaper prices contributed to low costs and low inflation worldwide. In modern history, that's an anomaly. Until the early 2000s, the West dominated world trade and the high-income economies' products and services were priced largely according to their purchasing power, which was significantly higher relative to those in middle- and low-income countries.Even worse, the Global South was exploited in imported proxy conflicts to keep Western growth undisrupted, somewhat like today. Emerging markets became more useful to the West only in the 1980s, when neoliberal policies permitted offshoring in the race to the bottom.Today any major threat to undermine Chinese trade poses a $6.1 trillion threat to China, the US, its allies and the Global South.$311 billion risk to world investmentLast year, global merger and acquisition activities soared to $5.9 trillion. China's outward foreign direct investment (OFDI), aligned with the post-pandemic upswing, displayed an uptick in growth, totaling $138 billion.China's inward FDI hit $173 billion, up 20.2 percent year on year. The robust double-digit growth is remarkable, due to the relatively high base in 2020. China registered positive growth of 5.7 percent, even as global FDI plunged 34.7 percent. In the process, Chinese engagement in the144 countries of the Belt and Road Initiative amounted to $59.5 billion (see figure 3).FIGURE 3. BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE Source: BRI Initiative, Silk Road Briefing Efforts remain to derail these investments as ""debt-trap diplomacy,"" by those who have a vested interest in anti-China geopolitics. Yet, reports by Johns Hopkins (US) and the Chatham House (UK) have debunked such claims.So, when major economies in the West seek to destabilize or contain China's economic rise for largely geopolitical reasons, they risk derailing over $311 billion in annual investment and trillions of dollars over time. That threatens the poorer economies' historical opportunity — however slim and fleeting — to raise living standards after centuries of colonial plunder by the West.Stagflationary debt crisisWith the US/EU proxy war against Russia in Ukraine, it was clear early on that all key participants in this unwarranted war would face a recession in a matter of months.Worse, the runaway inflation that the West is struggling with has potential to worsen into a stagflationary debt crisis. In the next recession, as Nouriel Roubini has suggested, ""the crash in equity markets could be closer to 50 percent."" The assumption is the crisis will prove both stagflationary and be accompanied by a financial crisis.In this dire landscape, a major destabilization of China could drastically compound downside risks worldwide, by accelerating secular stagnation, which continues to spread in the West, and by decimating opportunities for higher living standards in many emerging and developing economies.Given free rein, these unwarranted proxy conflicts and new Cold Wars will pave the way for a global depression.Dr. Dan Steinbock is an internationally recognized strategist of the multipolar world and the founder of Difference Group.

209;Where China's wealthy travelers are going during the pandemic;;2021-08-29 14:22:53;full;http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2021/8/29/China-wealthy-travelers.html;cnnphilippines.com;Wealthy Chinese travelers may not be able to travel internationally with ease these days, but they have no shortage of attractive travel destinations in their own backyard.;"(CNN) — The sandy shores of Sanya. The mountains of Yunnan. Giant panda sanctuaries in Sichuan.
Wealthy Chinese travelers may not be able to travel internationally with ease these days, but they have no shortage of attractive travel destinations in their own backyard.
And it seems the country is readying for yet another boom in domestic travel ahead of Golden Week in October.
After more than a month of strict restrictions and lockdowns to stamp out a Delta variant outbreak, China reported no new local COVID-19 cases on August 23 for the first time since July.
Before the outbreak -- which was the worst in China since 2020 -- domestic travel had been on the upswing.
According to a report by the China Tourism Academy, the sector expected approximately 4.1 billion domestic trips in 2021, reflecting a 42% increase compared with 2020. In addition, the academy has projected $511 billion in revenue from domestic tourism, up 48% year on year.
Meanwhile, an annual survey of high-net-worth individuals by Chinese research firm Hurun Report found that interest in domestic travel jumped 31% year on year and 44% of respondents said they planned to increase their travel spending.
""Outbound tourism is officially discouraged, and the quarantine-on-return requirements are onerous,"" Sienna Parulis-Cook, director of marketing and communications at Dragon Trail, a China-focused digital marketing agency, tells CNN Travel.
""There is also social pressure and a sense of responsibility that you should not risk others by traveling abroad and potentially bringing back the virus with you.""
While international travel remains challenging, wealthy travelers are taking every opportunity to explore their home country.
""Because China is so vast. There are so many different languages, cultures and foods as well -- different things grow in different regions,"" Jolie Howard, the CEO of L' VOYAGE bespoke private jet charter service based in Hong Kong, tells CNN Travel. ""There is so much variety.""
Destinations of choice
According to the 2021 Hurun Report, Sanya -- a tropical playground on the island of Hainan south of mainland China -- is the most popular destination among wealthy domestic travelers. Often referred to as the ""Hawaii of China"", it's filled with luxury resorts, many managed by international brands.
Ranking second is Yunnan, a mountainous region home to ancient cities, forests and tea plantations.
In Western media, the third and fourth destinations -- Tibet and Xinjiang, respectively -- often make headlines, but it's usually for reasons other than tourism.
Both regions have been under intense international scrutiny due to alleged human rights violations.
The US, along with human rights watch groups and other Western nations, has accused the Chinese government of genocide in Xinjiang and severely restricting freedoms in Tibet. China has denied such allegations.
Both destinations have remained popular among domestic travelers. Xinjiang, in particular, saw an uptick in visitors after brands like H&M and Nike raised concerns about forced labor earlier this year, according to state-run tabloid Global Times.
As a travel destination, Tibet has a well-deserved reputation for breathtaking Himalayan scenery, ancient monasteries and delicious cuisine. And Xinjiang province, China's westernmost territory, is known for its ancient links to the Silk Road trade and Uyghur culture.
Meanwhile Sichuan -- famed for its giant panda sanctuaries, national parks and numbing regional cuisine -- rounds out the top five.
Why these destinations?
""They are traditionally popular among Chinese travelers, and the rich outdoor resources have made them even more popular among elite travelers,"" Mengfan Wang, Dragon Trail's Shanghai-based manager of research, tells CNN Travel.
Outdoorsy experiences and adventure tourism have been key trends within the domestic tourism rebound, she adds.
""Rural high-end B&Bs have seen double-digit growth, especially in popular destinations such as Moganshan -- an area of natural beauty close to Shanghai.""
According to Wendy Min, Trip.com Group spokesperson, the group has seen an uptick in bookings for bucket list destinations like Shanghai Disney, Beijing's Forbidden City and The Great Wall of China -- all offering ""easy, convenient travel, great cultural experiences, and top-rated accommodations.""
""We've seen increased visitor numbers in places like Guangzhou, Chongqing, Zhuhai, Dunhuang and Quanzhou -- a newly listed UNESCO site -- is no doubt on many travel wishlists,"" Min tells CNN Travel.
Safety remains paramount, along with can't-miss experiences and attractive scenery that ""lends itself to great photography.""
By land and sea
Wealthy Chinese travelers aren't just choosing their destinations differently -- they're also changing the way they get from point A to B to C.
Driving has become the dominant form of transportation in areas such as Shanghai and Guangdong, says Wang.
""Many people will also fly into a top city (like Shanghai) and then take a popular self-driving route in the southwest and northwest regions of China,"" she adds.
Along the same lines, Wang's colleague Parulis-Cook says young and wealthy Chinese have also been taking road trips in luxury vehicles, renting high-end campervans and glamping at exclusive campgrounds.
""This trend is highly influenced by social media and the opportunity to take photos while glamping -- on social media platform Xiaohongshu, for example, users pose with Fendi handbags or Hermes blankets at their campsites,"" adds Parulis-Cook.
Meanwhile, yachting has become increasingly popular in leisure destinations such as Hainan island -- a longtime favorite among elite Chinese thanks to its duty-free shopping, sandy beaches and lush golf courses.
According to data from the Hainan Free Trade Port, the number of newly registered yachts in Sanya in the first half of 2021 grew 220% year over year.
More travelers are flying solo
Private air travel also appears to be riding a jetstream.
""We're seeing a lot of new clients -- maybe they weren't using private jets before COVID-19 because commercial airlines were easy enough. Now, they want to travel privately because it's safer, faster (in terms of waiting for COVID-19 tests), and you have access to all different airports,"" says Howard of L'VOYAGE.
""We've even seen a lot of growth in terms of clients buying their own planes after chartering a private jet for some time.""
This pattern, she says, reminds her of the industry's momentum after the SARS outbreak in 2003.
""At that time, private aviation got a lot of visibility and, again now, we are gaining a lot more awareness.""
And while their core customers in China continue to be business travelers, Howard has also observed a shift in travel habits.
""It's often a combination -- for example, our clients may go to Sanya for a business meeting then meet the family for a few days of holiday.""
Craving deeper experiences
When it comes to purely leisure travel, Howard says the company's clientele prefer to explore far-flung locales -- like Yunnan, Tibet or Xinjiang -- that require a more substantial time investment.
When it comes to purely leisure travel, Howard says the company's clientele prefer to explore far-flung locales -- like Yunnan, Tibet or Xinjiang -- that require a more substantial time investment.
""Before the pandemic, there were international alternatives because people could go overseas. But now, we are seeing elite travelers choosing destinations with nice clean air, beautiful scenery ... like the beautiful mountains in the Yunnan area.""
""You need more than just two to three days in these adventurous places. You need time to explore, go hiking or have cultural experiences.""
No matter where elite Chinese travelers go, Howard says excellent food is a key requirement.
""The food element is always very important for our customers because, culturally, the Chinese socialize around the dinner table,"" she explains.
""A place like Sichuan is a good example since it has great food, as well as authentic ways of growing and producing ingredients. So our clients would likely want to visit an organic farm to learn more about how things are grown, get back to nature and enjoy the fresh air.""
Pent-up demand for overseas travel
While high-net-worth travelers have been busy clocking miles within China's borders throughout the pandemic, Dragon Trail says there's plenty of pent-up demand for international trips.
Parulis-Cook expects wealthy and experienced travelers in China to return overseas as soon as it feels safer, more manageable and socially acceptable.
""I would say for high-net-worth travelers, where travel is part of their lifestyle, it's much less about having a newfound preference for domestic travel,"" says Parulis-Cook.
""But rather, current restrictions make outbound travel unappealing in many ways. It's not only inconvenient but also looks bad and irresponsible.""

The classics are classics for a reason — from the awe-inspiring architecture of Angkor Wat and the Taj Mahal to the buzzy metropolises of Tokyo and Hong Kong and the beaches of Bali and Phuket, it's impossible for any traveler to find something not to their liking.

But for the travelers who are fortunate enough to have time to dig a little bit deeper, there are less-crowded, equally-rewarding treasures to be found.

CNN Travel tapped into our network of colleagues and contributors to ask them where the locals go. Here's what they had to say.

Ipoh, Malaysia

When it comes to great Malaysian food cities, most people think of Penang. But that's only because they haven't been to Ipoh.

The capital city of Perak state, Ipoh's location between Kuala Lumpur and Georgetown makes it an ideal stop for any Malaysian road trip. It's also the gateway to Cameron Highlands, a district known for its cool weather and tea plantations.

Ipoh's food and world famous white coffee are enough reasons to visit but there are also magnificent limestone hills and caves that are home to unique temples as well as amazing hidden bars.

Visit the Chinese temples of Perak Tong, Sam Poh Tong and Kek Lok Tong and be blown away by intricate stone carvings and bronze statues of Chinese deities surrounded by stalactites and stalagmites. Ipoh's colonial legacy is also evident in its architecture: from its Railway Station to the Birch Clock Tower, town hall and the Old Post Office.

Isaan, Thailand

As popular as Thailand is among international tourists, the country's northeast — collectively referred to as Isaan — is usually overlooked.

But for those in search of a less-traveled destination that includes historic architecture, dramatic landscapes and culinary delights, Isaan ticks all the right boxes, and then some.

Visitors will find it's one of the most welcoming destinations in Asia and easily accessible, thanks to excellent infrastructure that includes several domestic airports offering daily flights to Bangkok and a range of upmarket hotels.

The only challenge is deciding which highlights to experience. Made up of 20 provinces, Isaan shares borders with Laos and Cambodia, and their influences can be found in the region's cuisine, language, historic sites and festivals.

Attractions include the ancient Khmer ruins of Phenom Rung in Buriram, mountainous national parks in Loei, the 75 million-year-old ""Three Whale Rock"" in Bueng Kam and Bronze Age artifacts in the UNESCO-listed Ban Chiang Archeological Site in Udon Thani.

And then there's the food. Isaan cuisine, now prevalent on menus in Thai restaurants around the world, includes refreshing som tom (payaya salad), tangy Sai Grok Isaan (northeastern sausage) and larb, a flavorful minced-meat salad.

Leshan, China

Most people travel to Leshan city for the sole purpose of visiting the Giant Buddha. The world's biggest and tallest ancient Buddha statue is indeed stunning, but this Sichuan city deserves much more than a side trip from Chengdu.

The Mount Emei scenic area — home to the Giant Buddha — is also of great spiritual and cultural importance as the birthplace of Buddhism in China. Many ancient temples are scattered and ingeniously built on the cliffs of the pristine dense forest.

On top of sightseeing, Leshan is a hidden foodie paradise with local Sichuanese saying ""eating in Sichuan, tasting in Leshan."" This city is where Chengdu residents come for authentic bites of iconic Sichuan cuisine: chilled bobo chicken, jellied tofu, Qiaojiao beef, steamed meat with rice powder and more.

Skardu, Pakistan

Skardu district, in Pakistan's Gilit Baltistan region, is a land of stark gigantic beauty, with many of the highest mountains on the planet — most famously K2 — concentrated in this one area.

Deosai National Park sits on the second highest plateau in the world. It is a riot of color, alive with birds and butterflies. With no ambient city lights the stars are exceptionally bright, with the milky way looking so close it could be plucked out from the sky.

In contrast, there's the Sarfaranga Desert. The world's highest cold desert, it's filled with diamond-white sands and ebony mountains.

Skardu has been inhabited for centuries and is studded with ancient Buddhist stupas and carvings, beautifully preserved mosques from the Middle Ages and shrines of Sufi saints.

The Serena hotel chain has transformed the stunning Shigar Fort and Khaplu Palace into two of the country's best kept hotels. Both are filled with gardens and climate friendly wooden architecture while serving regional food like Mamtu dumplings and grilled trout.

Nikko, Japan

Nikko is just 150 kilometers (93 miles) north of Tokyo, but it feels like another world.

This small city is one of the most important sites in Japan for Shinto culture, with the ornate, gold-dripping Toshogu Shrine — a UNESCO World Heritage site — its centerpiece.

If peace is what you're after, Nikko is the place to find it. Nikko National Park comprises 443 square miles across three prefectures, with dramatic waterfalls, groves of fir and cedar trees, finely carved gates and rocky outcroppings among the things to experience.

The park is also home to some of Japan's famous natural hot springs, making Nikko an ideal autumn or winter destination.

While the area has long been popular with Tokyo urbanites looking for a bucolic weekend escape, Nikko is beginning to land on the radar of more international tourists -- a Ritz Carlton opened there just before the pandemic.

Dalat, Vietnam

With its fresh mountain air and pine forests in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, Dalat is a popular destination for local Vietnamese that isn't as well known among international travelers.

At 1,500 meters above sea level, the city's cooler weather is a welcome reprieve from the tropical humidity found elsewhere in the Southeast Asian country.

Centered around the romantic Xuan Huong Lake, Dalat boasts everything from French colonial architecture -- a holdover from its days as a hill station -- to the ""Crazy House,"" the Seussian creation of architect Đặng Việt Nga, with its twisting stairwells and whimsical sculptures. Plentiful waterfalls and a vibrant flower industry mean that delights abound in the city for honeymooners and nature lovers.

Davao, Philippines

Davao City is more than just a provincial capital of the southernmost part of the Philippines — it's a true mosaic of Filipino cultures seen nowhere else across the country.

There's food for everybody at the Roxas Night Market, which is lined with barbecue and grilled seafood, along with humble yet complex delicacies such as the fresh seaweed salad called lato and hearty law-uy vegetable soup. Nothing represents Davao more than pungent durians, which grow in abundance across the region as well as pineapples, bananas and sugarcane -- served in all forms from shakes to pies.

The city takes pride in its indigenous roots and celebrates the Kadwayan Festival in August to showcase local textiles, woodwork, song and dance from 11 tribes that reign from the mountains and its surrounding sea.

A ferry ride away from the city will transport you to luxurious Samal Island, best known for its pristine beaches and pearl farms. Take a roadtrip along the palm tree-lined paths that lead to the surfer spot of Mati, or perhaps a detour to Mount Apo, the highest mountain and volcano in the Philippines.

Meghalaya, India

The northeast Indian state of Meghalaya, which translates to ""abode in the clouds,"" boasts some of the country's most peaceful and lush landscapes. As it requires a permit, it can be challenging to visit. But it's worth it.

Meghalaya is home to the towns of Cherrapunji and Mawlynnong. Both hold records for being the wettest places on Earth, having received nearly 12,000 mm (472 inches) of rain a year. The results are verdant, leafy forests with rivers and creeks running through that can be explored through crossing the state's famous bridges.

Built by locals out of the roots of ficus trees, some are as old as 500 years and symbolize the self-sufficiency of the Khasi indigenous tribe and their relationship with the forest. The living root bridges, known as ""jingkieng jri"" in the Khasi language, can be found in over 70 villages and continue to be used and nurtured by locals to keep them alive for future generations.

In 2022, they were added to UNESCO's tentative list of World Heritage sites. The most famous living root bridges are the Umshiang Double Decker root bridge in Nongriat village, south of Cherrapunji, and one in Riwai near Mawlynnong, certified as the ""cleanest village in Asia"" since 2003 by UNESCO.

Palau Ubin, Singapore

Thought Singapore was all about parties and skyscrapers? Think again. Located offshore from its northeast Changi region is Pulau Ubin (Malay for ""granite island""), a nature lover's paradise with jungle trails, mangrove wetlands and majestic quarries.

Getting around the island is a breeze: In true Singaporean style, everything is well-marked, from jungle trails to concrete footpaths, but the island still remains very untouched.

Mountain biking is particularly popular, especially on weekdays when crowds are few. But Ubin really comes to life on weekends -- when families, couples and nature lovers descend, hoping to catch a glimpse of old Singapore.

One of the most popular attractions on the island is Chek Jawa, a saltwater mangrove wetland rich in marine life. A well-built wooden boardwalk runs through the mangrove, allowing visitors to observe plant and marine life such as sea sponges, octopuses, starfish and cuttlefish, at close range.

Samosir Island, Indonesia

Indonesia is comprised of several thousand islands -- and, in the case of Samosir, an island on a lake within an island.

Samosir Island is a volcanic island in North Sumatra's Lake Toba. one of the world's largest crater lakes.

The Batak tribe calls this land their home, and you can meet these locals as they sell handicrafts from their villages along the waterfront, where their houses are built from wooden beams lashed to stones and have tall red roofs that resemble a ship's sails.

As Samosir is several hours' drive and ferry ride from the closest airport, opt to spend the night in a homestay and support the community by purchasing ulos, a UNESCO-recognized woven, naturally dyed cloth that is used in every important facet of Betak life.

Pakse, Laos

Northern Laos — home to elegant Luang Prabang and adventure-loving Vang Vieng — get the lion's share of attention. But head south for a different kind of experience in Pakse, where two rivers converge in the country's second biggest city.

Pakse is diverse, pulsing and modern. It has buildings left over from the days of French colonialism, but these days Vietnamese and Chinese communities bring their foods, traditions and references alongside the existing Lao presence.

While in town, head up to the giant gold Buddha at Wat Pho Salao, stroll along the Mekong at sunset, and then go off to the Bolaven Plateau to get deeper into jungle.

Bangladesh

India casts a long tourism shadow over its neighbors, including Bangladesh. But this smaller nation has outsized offerings many travelers to South Asia might not realize. This is especially true in architecture, history, nature and food.

In the capital of Dhaka, the Ahsan Manzil is an ornate, stunning vision in pink. Set on the banks of the Buriganga River, it was finished in 1872 during the British colonial era as a palace for the local rulers of the time. It is now a popular museum.

Tengchong, China

Even though China is still closed to international tourists, Yunnan province has already welcomed about 350 million domestic visitors in the first half of 2022 alone.

If you'd like to see the historical Yunnan like an experienced local, head to Tengchong.

Bordering Myanmar in the west of Yunnan, Tengchong has been a critical trading stop on the historic Silk Route and Tea Horse Road in the past.

Today, many local travelers first visit Heshun, an old town built surrounding a mountain and a lake. The Double Rainbow stone arch bridges, the Laundry Pavilion and the 98-year-old Heshun Library -- the biggest rural public library in China -- are some of the must-sees when visiting the cozy village.

Yinxing (Gingko) Village in the northern side of Tengchong is known for its thousands of ginkgo trees, turning the village golden yellow every autumn.
