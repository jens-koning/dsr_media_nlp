From the second century to the middle of the 15th century, the Silk Road, or more appropriately, the Silk Routes, provided a way for trade and culture to be exchanged between Asia and Europe. The routes connected East and West across more than 6,400 kilometers, allowing economic, cultural, political, and religious exchange to take place. Research published in the 
European Journal of International Management
 takes a look at the online successor to the Silk Routes, China's Digital Silk Road initiative. 
 
 
As China's Digital Silk Road (DSR) gains momentum, nations in Central and Eastern Europe are at a crossroads, trying to navigate the implications of more and more integration of their infrastructure with Chinese technology. There are concerns about the economic, security, and technological ramifications across the region, but the current research reveals a map of distinct approaches. Some of these could lead to gridlock in some places or open up new routes for exploration in others.

The DSR is critical to China's global technology push. With it, the nation and its technology giants are entwining digital prowess with economies worldwide, with Europe, a key part of its ambitions. The unasked question is whether Europe should get on board or be more cautious of hitching a ride with Chinese technology.

Ágnes Szunomár of the Institute of Global Studies at Corvinus University of Budapest and Institute of World Economics, Center for Economic and Regional Studies in Budapest, Hungary, has probed the responses of central and eastern European nations to the DSR challenges and opportunities. Some countries are cautiously skeptical while others are entertaining more and more collaboration.

The motivation, however, is not solely technological, nor even economic, but politically driven. Indeed, 
security concerns
 and the influence of U.S. diplomacy as well as Germany's technology and stance have often rerouted the roadmap for other nations hoping to navigate the DSL. At least one prominent company has led to various countries to stray from the map and yet others to follow the route almost by rote.

For the DSR initiative itself, Chinese companies themselves could pivot the European response by emphasizing the global nature of the emerging technology and the opportunities and downplaying the national nature of the initiative. However, changing Western perceptions and alleviating security concerns remain formidable challenges. Even a journey of 6,400 kilometers must begin with a single step.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping clearly aspires to establish a new global economic order centered around Beijing, not Washington. However, a new global economic order cannot be built in a day. The immensity of this challenge has forced Xi to set his sights on a set of interim goals. These include cementing the Communist Party's control of the Chinese economy and shielding supply chains, capital flows, and strategic bilateral and multilateral relationships from hostile American policies.


These goals equate to the creation of a Sinocentric global economic subsystem. This would be partially integrated into the current Western-led system but would be sufficiently decoupled from the West to protect the pillars of the Chinese Communist Party's political economy.


In Beijing's grand design, the Middle East plays an indispensable role. But Western analysts have often misjudged China's interests in the region as purely commercial. While Xi values the region for its economic potential, he sees it as one of the most important arenas of competition with the United States.


Yet when United States National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan recently discussed American leadership of the global economy, he focused on Europe and the Indo-Pacific and mentioned Africa and Latin America. He did not mention the Middle East once.
1


Washington's persistent blind spot in the Middle East has obscured its view of Beijing's global ambitions. If the US does not rectify this mistake, it risks losing more influence in the region and aiding China's effort to supplant the US atop the global economic order.  


The Appeal of the Middle East


Xi faces multiple hard facts as he endeavors to construct a Beijing-led economic bloc. The US and its allies continue to dominate key sectors of the global economy, from finance to high-tech industries like robotics, aeronautics, semiconductors, and closed-circuit chips. Additionally, the US dollar remains the international reserve currency.


Moreover, China lacks domestic reserves of oil. This disadvantage puts a hard ceiling on the potential of Chinese manufacturing. Beijing currently relies on Iranian and Russian oil, which are discounted due to American economic sanctions. By maintaining strong strategic ties with Middle Eastern oil producers, the West can retain leverage over any prospective Sinocentric bloc in the region.


Yet Xi wants China to be more than a manufacturing hub. He seeks to take the lead in high-tech sectors that will help Beijing to establish new international standards, create an alternative global financial system, and achieve self-sufficiency in strategic industries. As Hudson's John Lee has demonstrated, China's dependence on Western technology makes it economically vulnerable. Beijing has launched multiple initiatives to mitigate this vulnerability by making the West reliant on Chinese technology and other manufacturing inputs.
2


The Middle East holds the potential to facilitate Xi's hegemonic ambitions. Middle Eastern states possess substantial capital reserves to invest either in China or in other countries through partnerships that China facilitates. China, meanwhile, would benefit from using the Middle East as a market for its high-tech products and will depend on the region as an energy source for decades to come. Gulf countries, which have become disenchanted with the US, have welcomed Beijing's efforts to tighten relations.


These factors render the region uniquely attractive to Beijing as it seeks to overcome its economic challenges.


Belt and Road Rescue


Launched in 2013, Xi's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) aims to lay the groundwork for a Sinocentric economic bloc through extensive infrastructure projects abroad. The BRI is a wide-ranging initiative, comprising the Silk Road Economic Belt and the Twenty-first Century Maritime Silk Road. With total investments nearing $1 trillion, the BRI seeks to strengthen China's economic growth, promote Chinese exports, expand the reach of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and secure Beijing's control over key commodities.
3


Despite its initial promise, many of China's BRI partners no longer view the initiative favorably. It has even acquired skeptics within the CCP. Persistent corruption and low construction standards have created substandard infrastructure and trapped several BRI participant countries in debt crises.
4


Sri Lanka is an instructive example. Once the BRI's crown jewel, China has made significant investments in high-profile infrastructure projects, including a deep-water port at Hambantota. Trapped under an unmanageable debt load, Sri Lanka spiraled into a severe economic crisis. Essential supplies like food, fuel, and medicine became scarce. In 2017, China took over the Hambantota port on a 99-year lease, giving China a valuable position from which to monitor Indian Ocean shipping routes. Sri Lanka sought to restructure its debt to facilitate a $3 billion International Monetary Fund bailout, but China, Sri Lanka's primary lender, took an uncompromising position that prolonged negotiations.
5
 At the end of 2022, Colombo owed Chinese lenders $7.4 billion, nearly one-fifth of Sri Lanka's public debt.
6


Detractors claim cases like Sri Lanka's are the inevitable consequence of the Chinese approach to international development projects. Unlike the American model, which uses official government aid, China has relied heavily on capital sourced from both development banks and state-run commercial lenders.
7
 At Beijing's behest, these institutions sometimes offer below-market interest rates to borrowers who would otherwise struggle to secure funding. As a result, these Chinese institutions have underperformed compared to their global peers.
8


While this model has delivered Beijing some strategic benefits, it has also become a headache. Beijing now faces a scarcity of investment capital, and China's rapid economic growth and extensive borrowing in recent decades have put it at risk of a potential debt crisis. This is reflected in China's high debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio, which reached a record 279.7 percent in the first quarter of this year.
9
 Local governments' hidden debt poses a further challenge for Xi. Years of debt accumulated for infrastructure projects and other expenses, the costs of Xi's zero-COVID campaign, and the government's crackdown on property market leverage have strained local government finances.
10
 The CCP claims local governments officially owe around $5.1 trillion. But the actual amount is likely much higher.


The Chinese property market has been a major driver of the country's GDP growth. But it has suffered since the government implemented measures to curb excessive borrowing and speculative activity in 2021. Private developers now face overwhelming debts they cannot repay. China's second-largest property developer, Evergrande, defaulted in late 2021. Chinese banks' balance sheets now bear the combined burden of the debt obligations of local governments and the decreased value of property market loans.


While some analysts believe that the Chinese financial system is unlikely to melt down, the debt crisis remains a significant drag on economic growth. It has led to job losses, spending cuts at the local government level, and reduced investments in both domestic and international infrastructure.
11
 As the Chinese government works to determine the country's long-term economic trajectory, it has to manage debt levels and deleverage investments to ensure financial stability.


Such an onerous economic environment explains why Beijing has taken an interest in the Middle East. Affluent Gulf countries possess the necessary financial resources to support China's ambitious goals, and Beijing sees significant strategic value in strengthening economic ties with the region. For this reason, China focused a substantial portion of its BRI activities in the Middle East in 2022.
12
 So American policymakers should understand that the Middle East is a locus of increased competition against China.


High-Tech Ambitions


Technology leadership is another developing front in the rivalry between the US and China. In 2015, the Chinese government introduced its Made in China 2025 initiative to accelerate its technological advances and establish Chinese dominance in key tech sectors. Although a global backlash forced the CCP to officially disavow the program, MIC 2025 remains an important pillar of Xi's economic strategy.


The initiative targets ten important sectors, including electric vehicles, telecommunications, advanced robotics, and artificial intelligence. To enhance its manufacturing capabilities in these sectors, China subsidizes investment and mobilizes SOEs. According to some allegations, China even employs tactics like intellectual property theft and cyber espionage.
13


In 2015, China also launched the Digital Silk Road (DSR) to enhance digital connectivity in BRI countries. The DSR aims to build the necessary infrastructure for a new digital economy centered around China. Investments in wireless networks, surveillance cameras, subsea cables, satellites, and other digital technologies are key components of the DSR. Chinese companies such as Huawei expand their reach abroad by helping developing countries adopt 5G networks while China advances its critical tech sectors at home. This strategy includes cloud services and major applications like smart cities, mobile payment systems, and surveillance technology. China's expanding sphere of influence in technology development serves Xi's ambition to change China from a standard-taker, such as in wireless technology, to a standard-maker.
14


Despite its advantage in 5G networks, China faces significant challenges in capturing high-tech and high-value supply chains. American, European, and Japanese firms still dominate crucial sectors like robotics, aeronautics, semiconductors, closed-circuit chips, high-performance machine tools, airplane tires, and precision ball bearings.


China has used generous state subsidies to help both SOEs and private firms in the tech sector achieve scale and market share. But this approach has come at the expense of the Chinese private sector. Such intervention has stifled innovation and complicated business partnerships with Western companies, which have been instrumental to China's rise so far.


Furthermore, if China aims to dominate the global trade of high-tech goods and services, it needs continued access to American and European markets. Yet competition with the US has only intensified. For example, the US and its allies have raised trade restrictions and non-tariff trade barriers, making it more difficult for Chinese companies to access Western markets.
15


While trade with the West may be difficult, China sees the Middle East, especially Gulf countries that wish to diversify their economies, as low-hanging fruit ready for picking. Many Gulf countries, along with Turkey and Egypt, are already part of the DSR. China's construction of 5G networks and investment in data centers in the Gulf states align with development strategies like Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 framework and provide China access to large export markets. Importantly for China, Gulf export markets have a strong connection to the West.


Self-Sufficiency


To further its technological progress and accelerate the growth of a Sinocentric economic sphere, China is pursuing economic security and self-reliance. The Dual Circulation Policy (DCP), which China incorporated into its Fourteenth Five-Year Plan in May 2020, is crucial to this pursuit. The DCP aims to reduce China's dependence on international financial and technology markets by enhancing its domestic capabilities. To achieve this, Beijing aims to strengthen the symbiotic relationship between its domestic and international markets and make its domestic market the primary driver of its economic growth. By anchoring its economic development in its domestic market, China seeks to limit its vulnerability to international volatility—particularly growing hostility from Washington.
16


The DCP is designed to position China as a global manufacturing powerhouse in high-value-added products, achieve higher levels of self-sufficiency in critical sectors, and diversify supply chains to ensure access to essential inputs. For example, China aims to control strategic supply chains in the energy sector. To do so, it builds extensive capabilities in sectors that are midstream and downstream from energy production. Further, by becoming the world's largest client for the natural resources and manufacturing inputs that it cannot source domestically, China seeks to influence global markets, set prices, and establish standards.


China has already made significant progress in this regard. It refines a large percentage of the world's nickel, copper, lithium, and cobalt, and it is gaining leverage over the supply chain for products like electric vehicles and batteries.
17
 As mentioned above, Beijing has also purchased cheap oil from sanctioned countries like Russia and Iran to increase its share of the refining market and make the Chinese manufacturing sector more competitive.
18
 China now boasts significant oil storage facilities and recently surpassed the US as the world leader in refining capacity.
19
 China's strong position within global energy supply chains serves as a strategic shield from potential American sanctions, particularly if China were to invade Taiwan.


China's infrastructure investments in the Middle East highlight its commitment to strengthening this strategic shield. In the United Arab Emirates, China has constructed facilities at Khalifa Port and a pipeline stretching from the major oil field in Habshan to the Port of Fujairah. China has also invested in the Duqm Port in Oman. These projects demonstrate China's focus on bolstering its";follow.it;2292;news;IT;en;Amna Ansar,Hudson Institute,Prosperity,Sheikh Mansoor;https://i0.wp.com/www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/b-300.png?fit=800%2C450&ssl=1;False;;23.516417;451cdf0894a868e2b926ee41063f7419;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND DSR', 'lang': 'en', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'from': '3 years ago', 'sort_by': 'date', 'page': 1}

 is the world's largest private lender, yet nearly 60 per cent of Chinese overseas loanstoday are held by countries considered financially distressed. To put this in context, in 2010 this figure was just 5 per cent.

's 

 plight has been magnified by COVID-19 and the Ukraine war. Indeed, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine accounted for 20 per cent of 

's overseas lending over the past two decades. 

's lending boom has truly ended, plus struggling countries like Pakistan are asking for debt restructuring.
The 

 peaked in 2018, five years ago. Although 

 is globally pushing its own take on security, development and digital governance, 

 is also, to a certain extent turning its focus inwards, returning to a centuries-old practice of retreating within its borders.

's narrative was that the 

 would increase connectivity and infrastructure. Indeed, 

 listed five priorities: coordinating policy; improving connectivity; reducing impediments to trade; integrating financial structures; and building people-to-people ties through exchanges/dialogues.
However, it rapidly morphed into a hydra where absolutely any overseas project was subsumed under its umbrella. Around 2016, Chinese investment in rail, road, port and pipeline projects boomed, but 

's economic woes have slowed down such efforts since 2018/19. There is also a noticeable trend from hard infrastructure projects towards digital infrastructure ones.
Indeed, the 

's future seems to rest on the Digital Silk Road (DSR), launched in 2015. As another tangent, the ""Health Silk Road"" projects intensified in 2020 as 

 exported COVID-19 vaccines and medical supplies.
Initially, 

 investment was directed towards Central Asia and Southeast Asia, before spreading westward and into Africa. Since 2018, Latin America and the South Pacific received a lot of attention. However, South Asia and Southeast Asia ultimately emerged as the main foci.
Earlier this month, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) issued its annual Asia-Pacific Regional Security Assessment. Meia Nouwens, Senior Fellow for Chinese Security and Defense Policy at IISS, contributed a chapter entitled 

's 

 a Decade on.
Nouwens discussed the implications for four key regions. Beginning in Southeast Asia, she said this region will remain Beijing's chief area of strategic importance. 

 has been ASEAN's largest trading partner since 2009, and the bloc has been 

's largest trading partner since 2020. Maritime routes run through Southeast Asian chokepoints too, encouraging 

 to push railways as an alternative.
Key recipients have been Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, the Philippines and Vietnam. Naturally, 

 wants Southeast Asia to be non-aligned, to serve as a bulwark against American influence.
However, 

 is not doing itself any favours with continual harassment of Philippine and Vietnamese commercial and law enforcement activities in the South 

 Sea. Western countries are leery of adopting Chinese 5G telecommunication networks, but this is not the case in many developing countries.
Nonetheless, as 

 exerts tighter control over domestic private-sector technology companies, this will complicate their ability to execute projects overseas. The USA's stricter regulation of semiconductor and microchip technologies will also complicate 

's ambitions.
According to Nouwens, fear of economic dependency, ethnic tensions, project build quality and corporate social responsibility remain troubling issues for 

. Ethnic tensions often result from beliefs that Chinese-led projects benefit migrant workers rather than the local population. In Indonesia, for instance, Chinese guest workers rose from 17,515 in 2015 to 30,000 in 2018.
Considering the South Asia region, unsurprisingly it is Pakistan that has received the lion's share of 

 investment, absorbing more than half the money. 

's heavy investment in road, rail and pipeline infrastructure through the Himalayas as part of the 

-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is not paying economic dividends, however.
Indeed, it is far more expensive to transport products overland through Pakistan than by traditional sea routes. For instance, if shifting 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day via the Burma-

 pipeline, and 250,000 barrels daily through the Pakistan-

 pipeline, 

 would lose approximately USD1 billion per year compared to the traditional seaborne tanker route.
Another estimate predicts that shipping oil from the Persian Gulf to 

's east coast would cost USD2 per barrel, whereas it would cost USD15 per barrel via the Pakistan overland pipeline. Nouwens commented, ""The 

 in South Asia has achieved its intended goal of
exporting Chinese industrial overcapacity abroad. From 2010-18, for example, the value of Chinese industrial goods exports to Pakistan increased from USD3.1 billion to USD8.2 billion. Nevertheless, South Asian 

 projects have faced security, political, economic, geographic and governance challenges.""Furthermore, ""Chinese investments in the region have not necessarily created more favourable conditions for Beijing's influence. Chinese investment in South Asia has been one factor encouraging India to align more closely with the West, notably through the Quad.""
 
As for Central Asia, boosting ties there is helping 

 develop its own poorer western provinces. From 2016-21, annual 

-Europe freight train journeys snowballed from 1,702 to 15,183.
Nonetheless, most trade between 

 and Europe still travels by sea (95+ per cent in Germany's case), and the Ukraine war has led to a 34 per cent drop in volume via the northern rail corridor.
In the South Pacific region, Australia, New Zealand and the USA are very concerned about Chinese interests encroaching, especially since a 2018 uptick. One example is last year's Solomon Islands-

 security agreement. Nonetheless, this oceanic region attracts only a tiny proportion of 

 funds, with the largest beneficiaries being Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.
Nouwens concluded, ""Despite Chinese loans and grants to the sub-region, 

 and the 

 have made only a minimal impact in recipient Pacific Island states. There has not been any significant shift in Chinese investment or trade towards the sub-region, with the exception of Papua New Guinea. Exports from 

 to the South Pacific have increased twelvefold in value between 2000 and 2018, though the numbers for exports from Pacific Island countries to 

 have grown at a much less impressive rate.""
Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu are the most indebted islands to 

, with Tonga owing about 25 per cent of its annual GDP to the Export-Import Bank of 

. Interestingly, only Solomon Islands and Kiribati signed up for new Chinese loans between 2017 and 2021.
By 2021, 64 per cent of 

 projects in Southeast Asia, the South Pacific and South Asiahad been completed, according to Nouwen's research. A further 22 per cent of projects were ongoing, and the remaining 14 per cent were still in the planning stage.
The 

, therefore, looks rosy, right? Yet Nouwens pointed out, ""...Judging implementation against these metrics risks overlooking both the fact that the last decade of 

 implementation has in some ways proved to be chaotic, and also the question of recipient countries' agency. The 

's rollout in the last ten years has lacked central bureaucratic oversight and control or a coherent implementation strategy.""
The 

 was initially run under vague action plans, with existing projects simply rebadged as 

 ones. As Nouwens noted, ""The reality of the 

 is that propaganda exceeds implementation, activity overtakes purpose, and actors further down the hierarchy have much latitude in interpreting the terms of their involvement. Instead of being seen as effective tools of statecraft, the 

 and DSR should perhaps be viewed as tools of the 

's 'party craft'.""
For this reason, the 

 has not had the widespread impact that many Western leaders feared during its peak in 2016. ""Importantly, the idea of debt-trap diplomacy turned out to be unproven, and 

's investment in nearly 60 ports worldwide has not - contrary to the expressed fears of some commentators - provided it with immediate access to a global network of dual-use ports, let alone naval bases,"" the IISS researcher concluded.
Elsewhere, Lee Jones and Shahar Hameiri, in a Chatham House August 2020 research paper entitled ""Debunking the Myth of Debt-Trap Diplomacy"", concluded ""that the 

 is, in fact, motivated largely by economic factors. It has also shown that 

's fragmented and poorly coordinated international development financing system is not geared towards advancing coherent geopolitical aims ... The 

 does not follow a top-down plan, but emerges piecemeal, through diverse bilateral interactions, with outcomes being shaped by interests, agendas and governance problems on both sides.""

's confused efforts, exacerbated by economic woes, have offered Western alternatives a fortuitous window of opportunity. However, to date, neither the USA nor the West has been able to offer the level of investment that the 

 has.Additionally, Nouwens explained that ""the notion that Beijing can leverage global debt as a strategic means to gain access to any and all strategic equity is a myth. Rather, it could be asked whether, instead of trapping sovereign countries in Chinese debt for strategic value, Beijing has inadvertently been caught in a debt trap of its own making.""
Fears of debt-trap diplomacy for client states have not really emerged. Ironically, 

 might be sufferings most from a debt trap, due to profligate and unregulated investment in the 

's early years, and the economic difficulties being faced by many recipients.
With the 

 facing stiffer headwinds, Xi has fine-tuned his prized 

 as he seeks to ram home perceived advantages. These three inchoate efforts are the Global Data Security Initiative (GDSI), Global Development Initiative (GDI) and Global Security Initiative (GSI).
Discussing each in turn, the GDSI was launched in 2020. Under it, 

 proposes a framework for data security, data storage and digital commerce. The chameleon-like concept seems to oscillate between security and the digital economy, depending on 

's target audience.The GDI was first mentioned by Xi at a UN General Assembly meeting in September 2021. Stated priorities are ""poverty alleviation, food security, COVID-19 response and vaccine, development financing, climate change and green development, industrialization, digital economy and connectivity"".
Although still unclear what the GDI actually is, more than 50 countries have joined the UN Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative. Naturally, the GDI propagates 

's views on human rights (development is posited as a prerequisite for human rights, making human rights voluntary) and Xi's efforts to reshape global rules and norms (where the ""greater good"" means that the state's preferences override individual rights).
As for the GSI, it was first proposed in April 2022, backed up by a 21 February 2023 concept paper. That paper listed six principles: common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security; respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries; abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter; taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously; peacefully resolving differences and disputes between countries through dialogue and consultation; and maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains.
Observers of 

 will have seen such phrases routinely bandied about, such as in reference to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They will also know that these commitments are both vapid and downright disingenuous. Beijing has no intention of applying these principles to Ukraine or anywhere else, except when it is to its own advantage.
The GSI seems to replicate 

's concept of ""Asia for Asians"" in other regions, ""which could potentially weaken the existing world order, as well as US capacity to help manage or resolve crises in other regions,"" according to Nouwens. The
IISS senior fellow concluded: ""These three initiatives aim to promote Chinese-centric norms and values in the Global South. This ambition will be particularly relevant in developing and emerging economies where 

 has invested heavily in development aid or infrastructure projects through the 

 and DSR. It also allows Beijing to continue to shape the international system in its favour at a time when large-scale infrastructure projects are not feasible due to economic conditions in 

 and questions of demand.""
""Beijing has previously argued that the 

 is 'an economic cooperation initiative, not a geopolitical or military alliance'. However, these three initiatives indicate that Beijing's engagement with the Global South is not just based on the provision of aid or helping to develop local economies; it is now expanding more formally to promote Chinese concepts of security, based closely on 

's own concept of comprehensive national security, its 'golden prescription for global challenges' and development, and the storage, processing and transfer of data globally according to Chinese norms."" As with 

, it is a case of buyer beware for every initiative that 

 dreams up.

Hong Kong, June 12 (ANI): When China's President Xi Jinping floated the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013, it was unclear what it actually entailed. Perhaps Xi did not know either, for there was not even consensus on its name - it was originally labelled the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, and then One Belt, One Road.
The BRI became a blue-ribbon project for Xi. Thus, his and, by extension, China's prestige became dependent on its success. Now, ten years on, China has had to tighten its belt and divert the road in new directions to keep the whole concept alive.
Consequently, China announced three new initiatives in 2021-22 and, although still rather vague, these are directed at gaining greater influence over the Global South, accelerating the perception of US decline, and promoting China's warped perspective of international order.

China is the world's largest private lender, yet nearly 60 per cent of Chinese overseas loanstoday are held by countries considered financially distressed. To put this in context, in 2010 this figure was just 5 per cent.
China's BRI plight has been magnified by COVID-19 and the Ukraine war. Indeed, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine accounted for 20 per cent of China's overseas lending over the past two decades. China's lending boom has truly ended, plus struggling countries like Pakistan are asking for debt restructuring.
The BRI peaked in 2018, five years ago. Although China is globally pushing its own take on security, development and digital governance, China is also, to a certain extent turning its focus inwards, returning to a centuries-old practice of retreating within its borders.
China's narrative was that the BRI would increase connectivity and infrastructure. Indeed, China listed five priorities: coordinating policy; improving connectivity; reducing impediments to trade; integrating financial structures; and building people-to-people ties through exchanges/dialogues.
However, it rapidly morphed into a hydra where absolutely any overseas project was subsumed under its umbrella. Around 2016, Chinese investment in rail, road, port and pipeline projects boomed, but China's economic woes have slowed down such efforts since 2018/19. There is also a noticeable trend from hard infrastructure projects towards digital infrastructure ones.
Indeed, the BRI's future seems to rest on the Digital Silk Road (DSR), launched in 2015. As another tangent, the ""Health Silk Road"" projects intensified in 2020 as China exported COVID-19 vaccines and medical supplies.
Initially, BRI investment was directed towards Central Asia and Southeast Asia, before spreading westward and into Africa. Since 2018, Latin America and the South Pacific received a lot of attention. However, South Asia and Southeast Asia ultimately emerged as the main foci.
Earlier this month, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) issued its annual Asia-Pacific Regional Security Assessment. Meia Nouwens, Senior Fellow for Chinese Security and Defense Policy at IISS, contributed a chapter entitled China's Belt and Road Initiative a Decade on.
Nouwens discussed the implications for four key regions. Beginning in Southeast Asia, she said this region will remain Beijing's chief area of strategic importance. China has been ASEAN's largest trading partner since 2009, and the bloc has been China's largest trading partner since 2020. Maritime routes run through Southeast Asian chokepoints too, encouraging China to push railways as an alternative.
Key recipients have been Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, the Philippines and Vietnam. Naturally, China wants Southeast Asia to be non-aligned, to serve as a bulwark against American influence.
However, China is not doing itself any favours with continual harassment of Philippine and Vietnamese commercial and law enforcement activities in the South China Sea. Western countries are leery of adopting Chinese 5G telecommunication networks, but this is not the case in many developing countries.
Nonetheless, as China exerts tighter control over domestic private-sector technology companies, this will complicate their ability to execute projects overseas. The USA's stricter regulation of semiconductor and microchip technologies will also complicate China's ambitions.
According to Nouwens, fear of economic dependency, ethnic tensions, project build quality and corporate social responsibility remain troubling issues for China. Ethnic tensions often result from beliefs that Chinese-led projects benefit migrant workers rather than the local population. In Indonesia, for instance, Chinese guest workers rose from 17,515 in 2015 to 30,000 in 2018.
Considering the South Asia region, unsurprisingly it is Pakistan that has received the lion's share of BRI investment, absorbing more than half the money. China's heavy investment in road, rail and pipeline infrastructure through the Himalayas as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is not paying economic dividends, however.
Indeed, it is far more expensive to transport products overland through Pakistan than by traditional sea routes. For instance, if shifting 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day via the Burma-China pipeline, and 250,000 barrels daily through the Pakistan-China pipeline, China would lose approximately USD1 billion per year compared to the traditional seaborne tanker route.
Another estimate predicts that shipping oil from the Persian Gulf to China's east coast would cost USD2 per barrel, whereas it would cost USD15 per barrel via the Pakistan overland pipeline. Nouwens commented, ""The BRI in South Asia has achieved its intended goal ofexporting Chinese industrial overcapacity abroad. From 2010-18, for example, the value of Chinese industrial goods exports to Pakistan increased from USD3.1 billion to USD8.2 billion. Nevertheless, South Asian BRI projects have faced security, political, economic, geographic and governance challenges.""Furthermore, ""Chinese investments in the region have not necessarily created more favourable conditions for Beijing's influence. Chinese investment in South Asia has been one factor encouraging India to align more closely with the West, notably through the Quad.""As for Central Asia, boosting ties there is helping China develop its own poorer western provinces. From 2016-21, annual China-Europe freight train journeys snowballed from 1,702 to 15,183.
Nonetheless, most trade between China and Europe still travels by sea (95 per cent in Germany's case), and the Ukraine war has led to a 34 per cent drop in volume via the northern rail corridor.
In the South Pacific region, Australia, New Zealand and the USA are very concerned about Chinese interests encroaching, especially since a 2018 uptick. One example is last year's Solomon Islands-China security agreement. Nonetheless, this oceanic region attracts only a tiny proportion of BRI funds, with the largest beneficiaries being Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.
Nouwens concluded, ""Despite Chinese loans and grants to the sub-region, China and the BRI have made only a minimal impact in recipient Pacific Island states. There has not been any significant shift in Chinese investment or trade towards the sub-region, with the exception of Papua New Guinea. Exports from China to the South Pacific have increased twelvefold in value between 2000 and 2018, though the numbers for exports from Pacific Island countries to China have grown at a much less impressive rate.""Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu are the most indebted islands to China, with Tonga owing about 25 per cent of its annual GDP to the Export-Import Bank of China. Interestingly, only Solomon Islands and Kiribati signed up for new Chinese loans between 2017 and 2021.
By 2021, 64 per cent of BRI projects in Southeast Asia, the South Pacific and South Asiahad been completed, according to Nouwen's research. A further 22 per cent of projects were ongoing, and the remaining 14 per cent were still in the planning stage.
The BRI, therefore, looks rosy, right? Yet Nouwens pointed out, ""...Judging implementation against these metrics risks overlooking both the fact that the last decade of BRI implementation has in some ways proved to be chaotic, and also the question of recipient countries' agency. The BRI's rollout in the last ten years has lacked central bureaucratic oversight and control or a coherent implementation strategy.""The BRI was initially run under vague action plans, with existing projects simply rebadged as BRI ones. As Nouwens noted, ""The reality of the BRI is that propaganda exceeds implementation, activity overtakes purpose, and actors further down the hierarchy have much latitude in interpreting the terms of their involvement. Instead of being seen as effective tools of statecraft, the BRI and DSR should perhaps be viewed as tools of the CCP's 'party craft'.""For this reason, the BRI has not had the widespread impact that many Western leaders feared during its peak in 2016. ""Importantly, the idea of debt-trap diplomacy turned out to be unproven, and China's investment in nearly 60 ports worldwide has not - contrary to the expressed fears of some commentators - provided it with immediate access to a global network of dual-use ports, let alone naval bases,"" the IISS researcher concluded.
Elsewhere, Lee Jones and Shahar Hameiri, in a Chatham House August 2020 research paper entitled ""Debunking the Myth of Debt-Trap Diplomacy"", concluded ""that the BRI is, in fact, motivated largely by economic factors. It has also shown that China's fragmented and poorly coordinated international development financing system is not geared towards advancing coherent geopolitical aims ... The BRI does not follow a top-down plan, but emerges piecemeal, through diverse bilateral interactions, with outcomes being shaped by interests, agendas and governance problems on both sides.""China's confused efforts, exacerbated by economic woes, have offered Western alternatives a fortuitous window of opportunity. However, to date, neither the USA nor the West has been able to offer the level of investment that the BRI has.
Additionally, Nouwens explained that ""the notion that Beijing can leverage global debt as a strategic means to gain access to any and all strategic equity is a myth. Rather, it could be asked whether, instead of trapping sovereign countries in Chinese debt for strategic value, Beijing has inadvertently been caught in a debt trap of its own making.""Fears of debt-trap diplomacy for client states have not really emerged. Ironically, China might be sufferings most from a debt trap, due to profligate and unregulated investment in the BRI's early years, and the economic difficulties being faced by many recipients.
With the BRI facing stiffer headwinds, Xi has fine-tuned his prized BRI as he seeks to ram home perceived advantages. These three inchoate efforts are the Global Data Security Initiative (GDSI), Global Development Initiative (GDI) and Global Security Initiative (GSI).
Discussing each in turn, the GDSI was launched in 2020. Under it, China proposes a framework for data security, data storage and digital commerce. The chameleon-like concept seems to oscillate between security and the digital economy, depending on China's target audience.
The GDI was first mentioned by Xi at a UN General Assembly meeting in September 2021. Stated priorities are ""poverty alleviation, food security, COVID-19 response and vaccine, development financing, climate change and green development, industrialization, digital economy and connectivity"".
Although still unclear what the GDI actually is, more than 50 countries have joined the UN Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative. Naturally, the GDI propagates China's views on human rights (development is posited as a prerequisite for human rights, making human rights voluntary) and Xi's efforts to reshape global rules and norms (where the ""greater good"" means that the state's preferences override individual rights).
As for the GSI, it was first proposed in April 2022, backed up by a 21 February 2023 concept paper. That paper listed six principles: common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security; respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries; abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter; taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously; peacefully resolving differences and disputes between countries through dialogue and consultation; and maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains.
Observers of China will have seen such phrases routinely bandied about, such as in reference to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They will also know that these commitments are both vapid and downright disingenuous. Beijing has no intention of applying these principles to Ukraine or anywhere else, except when it is to its own advantage.
The GSI seems to replicate China's concept of ""Asia for Asians"" in other regions, ""which could potentially weaken the existing world order, as well as US capacity to help manage or resolve crises in other regions,"" according to Nouwens. TheIISS senior fellow concluded: ""These three initiatives aim to promote Chinese-centric norms and values in the Global South. This ambition will be particularly relevant in developing and emerging economies where China has invested heavily in development aid or infrastructure projects through the BRI and DSR. It also allows Beijing to continue to shape the international system in its favour at a time when large-scale infrastructure projects are not feasible due to economic conditions in China and questions of demand.""""Beijing has previously argued that the BRI is 'an economic cooperation initiative, not a geopolitical or military alliance'. However, these three initiatives indicate that Beijing's engagement with the Global South is not just based on the provision of aid or helping to develop local economies; it is now expanding more formally to promote Chinese concepts of security, based closely on China's own concept of comprehensive national security, its 'golden prescription for global challenges' and development, and the storage, processing and transfer of data globally according to Chinese norms."" As with BRI, it is a case of buyer beware for every initiative that China dreams up.

Perhaps Xi did not know either, for there was not even consensus on its name - it was originally labelled the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, and then One Belt, One Road. The BRI became a blue-ribbon project for Xi. Thus, his and, by extension, China's prestige became dependent on its success. Now, ten years on, China has had to tighten its belt and divert the road in new directions to keep the whole concept alive.
Consequently, China announced three new initiatives in 2021-22 and, although still rather vague, these are directed at gaining greater influence over the Global South, accelerating the perception of US decline, and promoting China's warped perspective of international order.

most ambitious and far-reaching development initiatives in history
. It is also regarded by many in the West, the United States especially, as a not-so-subtle attempt by Beijing to reshape regional political orders in its favor. 


In this light of this, it is worth considering the BRI's impact in the Middle East. The region, home to a growing middle class, is home to several key international energy and sea trade routes. China's heavy investment in the Middle East in recent years, including through the BRI, is thus of particular concern to Washington. Reviewing how such efforts have fared over the past decade may yield some interesting insights.


Why BRI Matters to the Middle East


The BRI is primarily 
a series of projects
 (comprising both traditional physical and digital infrastructure) designed to connect and integrate cooperating partners—cities, markets, and countries—across regions. Given this, a particular partner's degree of connectivity plays a larger role than other factors, such as regime type or market share.


For Middle East countries, favorable geopolitical location and integration into key facets of the global economy play an essential role in China's BRI framework. Consequently, China has developed a deep commercial presence in port cities and industrial parks that link the Persian Gulf to the Arabian, Red, and Mediterranean Seas. Myriad observers regard this presence as a way for China to secure its energy supplies, expand its trade, and gain a foothold in the region.


China's engagement in the Middle East can be attributed to two primary drivers. First, it seeks to be recognized as a great power status domestically and by other states. The Middle East is a strategically important region, and China's engagement is seen as a way to increase its influence and stake in the global order. Second, it aimed to secure its economic interests in the region through the BRI framework and continued access to energy resources on which it is 
heavily dependent
. The BRI is thus a means for China to increase its channels for exporting goods, reduce trade friction, improve access to natural resources, build supply chains, and generate opportunities for Chinese companies to invest overseas and sell goods and services. To that end, over the past ten years, it has integrated the BRI framework with the Middle East countries' national development strategies.


As the BRI is a long-term initiative that will continue to evolve in the coming years, Beijing will need to carefully assess the success and impact of its projects in the Middle East to make informed decisions on how to proceed. The success of the framework in the Middle East depends on several factors, including the economic and political stability of the region, the quality of the BRI projects, and the willingness of host countries to cooperate with China. More importantly, BRI projects are essential for underdeveloped Middle East states dependent on external creditors to establish critical physical and digital infrastructures. These projects are already in operation or are entering the second and third phases of development. Unless alternative creditors support further development, countries in the Middle East will continue to depend on and work with China.


Assessing BRI Projects in the Middle East


Currently, BRI projects span fifteen Middle East nations and include major infrastructural and digital projects on land and sea. The status of these projects varies, with some being planned, ongoing, completed, halted, or canceled, providing insight into the present overall situation of BRI. Developing a deeper understanding can be challenging, however, due to 1) deliberate opacity surrounding BRI projects on both the Chinese and host regional countries' sides and 2) the sheer scale of the initiative, which spans large swathes of continents.


This lack of transparency is a major challenge for researchers and policymakers trying to understand BRI and its implications. Nonetheless, there is still a great amount of information available to consider. The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) 
China Connects database
, for example, provides a valuable overview of China's BRI investment and lending in the Middle East. The database also includes information on  
Digital Silk Road
 (DSR) investments, which can be understood to be the BRI's technological component—a digital bridge-building project intended to promote a new type of globalization via digital trade, digital infrastructure, cross-border e-commerce, mobile financial tools, Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies (big data, digital currencies, cloud computing, and so on).


In any case, the IISS China Connects data demonstrates that China is investing heavily in the Middle East, with 266 BRI projects between 2005 and 2022 (see Table 1). Most of those are either ongoing or have been completed, and there are only a few projects that have been canceled or halted (see Table 2). This is a positive sign for China, showing that the initiative is gaining traction in the region.


Of note is what is being funded. The data shows that China is investing heavily in digital infrastructure in the region, which will likely continue in the coming years as Beijing seeks to expand its global reach. Chinese companies invested in 202 DSR projects (76 percent of the total investment) compared to 64 traditional physical infrastructure projects (24 percent). These investments are likely to have a major impact on the region's economies and societies, and it will be important to monitor the impact of these investments in the coming years.


 






Breaking down by category, we see varying levels of progress. In regards to traditional physical infrastructure endeavors, out of 64 BRI projects, there are 4 planned projects, 20 projects ongoing, 37 projects completed, and 3 projects canceled (see Table 3).


 


In regards to digital infrastructure efforts, out of 202 DSR projects, there are 29 planned projects, 49 projects ongoing, 122 projects completed, and 2 projects halted (see Table 4).




Looking closer at what types of digital infrastructure projects are being supported reveals that China's most significant investment involves transferring technology, telecom, fiber optic cables, security information system, and financial technology (see Table 5).




As for physical infrastructure, China's most significant investments are in ports, railways, Special Economic Zones, trade agreements, and Health Silk Road projects—i.e., projects related to improving public health. (see Table 6).




Drawing Conclusions


What the IISS China Connects database shows is that, out of the billions of dollars in loans and investments that China has to Middle Eastern countries since the launch of the BRI, most of these have been for digital infrastructure projects, such as telecommunications and broadband networks. This illustrates that contrary to the popular conception that BRI is wholly focused on physical infrastructure projects, there is significant demand for digital infrastructure.


That is not to say there isn't any physical construction going on: roads, railways, and ports are certainly being built


At the same time though, the IISS database also shows that Chinese lending and investments in the Middle East have declined in recent years. This decline is likely due to several factors, including the global economic slowdown and the coronavirus pandemic. 


Ultimately though, the IISS database is probably incomplete. Despite the BRI's ambitious goals, there is little reliable information about how it unfolds. This is partly because there is no agreed-upon definition for what qualifies as a 
BRI project
. As a result, projects that started years earlier are often counted, and the BRI banner hangs over a comprehensive and ever-expanding list of activities. By design, the BRI is more a loose brand than a program with strict criteria. This lack of clarity has made it difficult to accurately understand the BRI's impact accurately. The result is competing interpretations of its effects: some have argued that the BRI is a major driver of economic growth and development, while others have warned that it leads to debt traps and environmental degradation.


What is certain, however, is that China is still the largest foreign investor in the Middle East, and it is likely to continue to play a critical role in the region's development. The emphasis on digital infrastructure is something that most Western observers are perhaps unaware of and would do well to consider. In the meantime, as the BRI's tenth anniversary passes by, China will take stock of its original agenda and make necessary adjustments to align with its current domestic and global priorities. The Middle East will remain a key region for the BRI, and it is evident that Beijing will continue its engagement for years to come.

6;India's Global Tech Alliance Choices Will Reduce Its Relevance In Its Own Neighbourhood;Pravin Sawhney;2023-05-25 21:35:10;full;https://thewire.in/diplomacy/indias-global-tech-alliance-choices-will-reduce-its-relevance-in-its-own-neighbourhood;thewire.in;Two critical decisions taken at the recent Quad summit will increase the gulf between India and other countries of South Asia.;"The overarching belief in India is that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the country has emerged as a global balancer amidst the ‘great changes unseen in a century' – as Chinese President Xi Jinping calls the reshaping of the twin global geopolitical and economic orders. The reality, however, is that India is headed towards strategic isolation and irrelevance in its own neighbourhood by 2030.


This is because of two strategic tech-centric decisions taken at the recent Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) leaders' meeting held on the margins of the G-7 summit in Japan. 


The first decision is to collaborate with the US-led drive in telecommunications including 5G and 6G, and in developing ‘standards' for critical and emerging technologies, especially in Artificial Intelligence (AI), and cybersecurity. ‘Standards' in technology relate to commonality in hardware, software, and platforms for interoperability to work together. 


Different tech standards will disrupt the global supply chain and force global companies to develop two sets of technologies: one to meet the US and developed nations' standards for the Global North, and another with Chinese standards supported by Russia for those which have joined the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO),  the BRICS  and, more generally, a major section of the Global South. Ironically, India – as part of the Quad and BRICS/SCO – will be caught riding two horses.


Consequently, Global North consumer nations – especially the US and European Union (EU) but also Japan and Australia – will face compatibility problems on the technology development front. It will thus become increasingly difficult for the US and EU to continue with their present policy of 
‘de-risk' from China – the pragmatic version of the impulse to ‘de-couple'
. 


‘De-risk' refers to China's exclusion from select technologies like advanced chips, while ‘de-couple' means the end of trade and commerce. Moreover, as China is the primary trading partner with 138 nations, digital logistics systems built on Chinese tech will make traditional trade and commerce with nations following US digital trade standards difficult or, at the very least more expensive.


Second, as part of their ‘partnership for cable connectivity and resilience', the Quad will leverage its expertise in the design, manufacturing, laying and maintenance of subsea cables to secure and diversify critical networks. This will result in a 'splinternet': the separation of the global internet into two sets of subsea cables developed and maintained, respectively, by the US and China. 


Together, these two Quad decisions – tacitly endorsed by the G-7 nations – will fragment globalisation by 2030 as far as the free flow of data, trade, capital, and human resources is concerned, and adversely impact the third and fourth industrial revolutions – concerned with the mobile internet economy (hardware digital connectivity in cyberspace) and the industrial internet economy (software digital connectivity in cyberspace).


At the core of the Quad decisions is a cross-border governance debate on two issues: cybersecurity and cyberspace governance, or rules regarding who will control data, which properly handled, will enhance a nation's innovation power.


Meanwhile, China's Digital Silk Road (DSR) was announced by Xi Jinping in 2017 as part of the Belt and Road (BRI)'s second phase. 
Since the DSR is about hardware and software cyberspace connectivity, it encapsulates both the third and fourth industrial revolutions (or the robotics age), and hence can shift the global geopolitical balance of power. 


China's hardware cyberspace connectivity comprises subsea cables, and fibre optic cables. The BeiDou Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) – which, with a total of 35 satellites, surpassed the US's Global Positioning System and was completed in 2020 – is commonly referred to as the Space Silk Road. It will help in monitoring the BRI. 


Software cyberspace connectivity, while building upon the third industrial revolution, is distinctly different since connectivity is replaced by autonomy undergirded by AI, 5G, big data, cloud computing, and blockchain technology. The US does not have any dynamic structure comparable to the DSR which offers prosperity to nations through advanced information technology such as broadband networks, e-commerce hubs, smart cities, efficient ways of doing business and so on.


Obama's pivot towards the Asia-Pacific region


Before discussing India in South Asia, let's understand the genesis of the tech war between the two big tech giants. Conscious of China's rise, which had shifted global geopolitics and geoeconomics from Europe to the Asia-Pacific region, the Obama administration in 2011 announced a ‘rebalancing' strategy aimed at Beijing. 


This ‘pivot' had two components: the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a huge trade and investment agreement with 12 Pacific rim nations, and a military repositioning, aimed at shifting 60% of US naval assets under its Pacific Command (PACOM) in Hawaii to meet the growing challenge of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and Navy (PLAN). 


To China's delight, the Trump administration withdrew from the TPP upon entering office in 2017. It instead focused only on deterrence (military power) and renamed the Asia Pacific as the Indo-Pacific. PACOM became the Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) to give centrality to India's role in this US-led deterrence system. This left the field open for China to further economic cooperation with the Asia-Pacific nations.


The Trump administration's Sputnik Moment came when China, in July 2017, released its super ambitious ‘New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan' to become a global leader in AI by 2030. 


Since all emerging technologies converge into AI, it has a dual use for ushering in prosperity through the fourth industrial revolution and changing the character of war. Thus, progress in and management of AI ecosystems will be the main issue in determining global polarity. It remains to be seen whether the world remains multipolar – since it is no longer unipolar – or moves towards bipolarity by the end of the decade, when progress in AI ecosystems by major powers becomes clear. The new bipolarity will, of course, be
 vastly different from the Cold War years since there would be no Iron Curtain but a fragmented globalisation led by the US and China. And once again, contours of unipolarity could emerge in the second half of the century.


China's 20/30 vision


Interestingly, the Trump administration failed to comprehend that the Sputnik Moment in China had come at the turn of the century itself, when the Chinese started using smartphones at a mass level. Unlike the rest of the world, China moved directly from a cash payment norm to mobile payment without a developed credit card system. 


By 2013, some 900 million Chinese were using mobile internet (smartphones connected to 4G wireless internet), which is more than the population of the US and Europe combined. Thus, in 2017, when China announced its AI plans, its mobile internet companies had an unrivalled consumer data pool which made it easy for them to convert from mobile internet for consumers (third industrial revolution) to industrial internet for enterprises (fourth industrial revolution).


Alongside, China's foray into international cyberspace connectivity started in 2009 as a junior partner in the joint venture for subsea cables with the 
UK-based Global Marine
. By 2019, China's 
Huawei Marine Networks
 had completed over one hundred projects involving shorter and longer trans-Atlantic distances using indigenous advanced subsea cables where the Chinese acquired expertise in laying them. 
China became the fourth largest supplier of subsea cables in the world
 and required no further assistance from foreign partners.


When 
Xi Jinping announced the Digital Silk Road
, the worldwide demand for subsea cables with greater bandwidth had increased. China was among the nations making advances in material sciences, optics, and data processing to enable higher capability in submarine-grade fibre. 


It was conscious about investing heavily in advanced subsea cables, terrestrial fibre optic cables, and other standalone infrastructure for the Huawei 5G wireless network that would allow data flow at greater speed, higher volumes, and minimal latency when compared to existing 4G networks. 


Unlike the US, where subsea cables are in the private sector, the Chinese government is backing its strategic cyber connectivity plans with policies, timelines, resources, subsidies, and loans. Since subsea cables carry over 95% of all international data, and with demand for data having increased exponentially, high-speed internet is expected to spur innovation, increase employment opportunities, exploit 5G potential, and prepare the world for 6G connectivity which is expected to be commercialised by 2030.


Four things that China got right


Starting in 2017, China took four important steps which have left the US wondering if it has been left behind in the fourth industrial revolution. One, it ushered in the industrial internet by converting internet companies into technology companies which have also helped launch start-ups. To optimise digital technologies, Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent among others started cloud services for users to rent and remotely access a range of computing services including servers, data storage, network, analytics, and databases. Realising that data was a strategic resource, the Chinese built industrial data centres for manufacturing and producing data to help further the capabilities of traditional industries.


Two, Xi, in October 2019, attested that blockchain technology was an important breakthrough for the next round of technological innovation and industrial transformation. Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger which is open for anyone to join. As the name suggests, it has a number of connected blocks, with each block having three items: data, hash (like a fingerprint, it is unique to a block), and the hash of the previous block. 


When any data is added or deleted in a block of this digital ledger, changes get automatically made in all blocks of the chain and the hash also registers it. With many checks in the system, tampering with data becomes impossible. This makes transactions quick, convenient, controlled, traceable, secure, and stable since all the people in the chain get to know the changes made in a block. 
In 2020, China launched the Blockchain Services Network (BSN)
, which is an overarching framework wherein various blockchains for different services are brought under one framework for each of digital monitoring.


Three, China launched the world's first 
Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), e-Yuan or e-Renminbi in April 2020
. Digital renminbi is the world's first digital currency issued by any country's central bank, which is not the case with cryptocurrency. 


Unlike the digital wallet system of Alipay and WeChat, digital renminbi is a representation of an actual amount in a bank, and not in some digital wallet. China, thus, has created a new monetary transfer pathway which is independent of the existing ones dominated by the US like the SWIFT system. 


So, on the face of it, the reserve currency (usually in US dollars) will not be affected by an alternate Chinese money transfer system. But once the BRI nations find out that the Chinese payment system is faster, cheaper, and more efficient, the importance of systems like SWIFT will diminish.


Eventually, all BRI countries that do business with China will realise that e-Renminbi is not just China's central bank issued currency but also a ticket to China's new digital payment system which would be supported by a secure and transparent BSN. For example, if a customer in a BRI nation buys physical containers from China, all he or she needs to do is make the payment in digital renminbi. Everything else, from customs clearance to shipment to exact delivery date will happen automatically and they will be able to trace and monitor the progress.


Lastly,  
China announced the dual circulation policy in September 2020
. This had two aspects. The first was to strengthen the domestic economy by supply chain structural reforms and distribution of wealth with the aim to bring more Chinese people into the middle class. This involved more medium companies working on digital industrial economy rather than a few big corporations like Alibaba, Weibo, and Didi Chuxing technologies. 


The second aspect of dual circulation policy was that foreign investments, free trade agreements, and free trade ports for engagement with the outside world were encouraged but not actively sought. The dual circulation policy came in for global criticism—that the Communist party did not want more power centres in the shape of huge Chinese corporations. This may not be entirely untrue, but the point was that this policy was to sharpen Chinese fourth industrial revolution at home before it was sold to the BRI nations. 


India's impending isolation in South Asia


Against this backdrop, let us consider India and its neighbourhood by 2030. India has rejected the ‘China fix' as foreign minister, 
S. Jaishankar recently said at a book launch
. According to him, ‘Indian growth cannot be built on Chinese efficiency (technology).' 


This was evident in 2021 when China's 
Huawei 5G was denied participation in India's 5G telecom trials
 not for technical reasons (it passed the technical tests in India), but on political grounds. While India declared it will have indigenous 5G, the reality is that 100% of 5G electronics have been imported. 


There is a truism in telecom: first class companies set standards, second class companies provide services, while third class companies make products; Indian companies fall in the last category. To be sure, 5G is the backbone of the industrial internet.


Moreover, the reality of India's poor manufacturing was conceded by Jaishankar when he said India's ‘focus on services was actually an excuse for being incompetent in manufacturing.'

biquitous digital authoritarianism simmers beneath the bifurcated geopolitical system unfolding in the wake of the war in Ukraine.


Under unprecedented sanctions from the West, Russia will only fall deeper into China's hands that will have repercussions for a new world order, the contours of which are already visible. It is a fallacy to gauge the depth of the China-Russia alliance in rerouted energy flows, ambitious agreements to bolster infrastructural capabilities, or even Beijing's eagerness to circumvent secondary sanctions to supply Moscow with weapons. The gravity of Beijing's dominance over Moscow can be gauged by seeing how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has executed and cemented its reach into Moscow's information control apparatus. Today, that apparatus is the backbone of Kremlin's statecraft.


And that should get India worried. It casts doubt on how far and how long sensitive communication and transaction with Russia can remain unscathed by Chinese spying, regardless of what Moscow wants.
 
Contrasting models of hegemony


The '
end of history
' led the United States to embark upon its ‘unipolar' moment. In pursuit to paint the world with a liberal democratic brush, the US found itself rummaging for global hegemony through unending wars, bloodshed, and unsuccessful attempts at installing democracies. Whereas its major rival China has stayed away from military debacles so far.


Among other capabilities, Beijing has quietly devised and executed strategies to set up the most sophisticated system of surveillance, digital authoritarianism, and espionage not only over its own people but against the 
rest of the world
 as well. The unethical use of technology is an integral part of the CCP's economic statecraft, particularly through networks like the 
Digital Silk Road 
(DSR). Platforms such as WeChat, Weibo, and TikTok and Chinese tech giants, including Beidou and Huawei, create and store databases on which China's digital 
authoritarianism 
thrives.


This set of strategies and technologies is very much cardinal to China's 'no-limits' 
friendship 
with Russia.

Kremlin's panopticonic gaze


Kremlin's first tangible crackdown on information closure and surveillance started with a 
presidential decree
 months after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War. In the same year, an inconspicuous Russian agency, Roskomnadzor, the country's internet and media regulator, was formed. Doubling up as a 
surveillance machine
, this ‘internet blocker' agency has emerged as the star performer in the ongoing Ukraine war. It has blocked more than 1.2 million URLs and has been instrumental in censoring Facebook, Twitter, and Google, among others, since the war with Ukraine started in February 2022.


The famed 
exodus
 of approximately several hundred journalists from Russia has also been caused by the crackdown unleashed by Roskomnadzor.


In a CCP-style manoeuvring of 24/7 surveillance over its citizens' internet communication and behaviour, the agency has also 
reportedly
 been using a secret monitoring system to identify activities pertaining to the ‘destabilisation' of Russian State and society. Federal Security Service's internet surveillance system, SORM-3, will be expanding scrutiny by threatening telecom users to cancel their licenses if they fail to install the software on their devices. 
The New York Times'
 
report
 of leaked Roskomnadzor documents shows that Russia's internet censor has been instrumental in shaping a conducive domestic information environment to steer favourable opinion as the Ukraine war goes on.


Roskomnadzor's emergence as the most potent tool for information blackouts and mass surveillance in 2022 has roots in a series of 
restrictive laws
, introduced from 2012 onwards, which have laid down an enabling legal framework around censorship.


For more than a decade, President Vladimir Putin has been building the Russian version of the Great Firewall of China by 
incorporating
 its elements into the 
Red Web
, the country's internet filtering and control system.


As Russia stood shunned by the G7 for its actions in Crimea in 
2014
, Xi Jinping exploited the wedge between the West and Moscow by offering the latter the most sensitive of State-domain information control and surveillance tools. Kremlin's aim to reclaim influence in its post-USSR neighbourhood unravelled with Moscow controlling information and mass surveilling its subjects in line with the official narrative of Russian statecraft. Russia's pursuit swayed the regime into the experienced hands of the People's Republic of China (PRC), which has had one of the most advanced digital authoritarianism paraphernalia in the world. In 2015, Russia and China signed an 
extensive cybersecurity pact
 under which the two countries promised not to hack each other, reserving their formidable cyber prowess for ‘predictable' adversaries.

The China-Russia ‘dark' 
proximity


In the summer of 2016, Russian conservative lawmaker Irina Yarovaya drafted a ‘reform' package as part of wider anti-terror legislation. The set of two 
widely criticised
 federal laws, thereon called the Yarovaya Laws, forced mobile and internet companies to log peoples' text messages, phone conversations, and chats for six months and hand over the data to security services if ordered by the courts.


A few months later, the next phase of an unprecedented China-Russia 
cyber collaboration
 began.


The massive amounts of data generated by Yarovaya's brainchild required befitting storage and processing capabilities that, by no means, could Russia have boasted of in 2016. After all, this was right after the first wave of technological sanctions by the West in the aftermath of the Crimean invasion.


With an eye on enhancing regime stability and legitimacy, the Yarovaya laws paved the way for Russia's collaboration with Chinese Great Firewall security officials to 
implement 
its data retention and filtering infrastructure.


These laws created the internet blacklist registry, managed by the 
Roskomnadzor,
 and mandated service providers to block access to any objectionable site. From 2012 to 2021, Google received 
2,34,000
 requests for the removal of about three million items from Russia alone. Perhaps it is safe to extrapolate why Google was 
banned
 in the first month after the Ukraine war.


Similarly, the 2013 
Federal Law 389-FZ
, with an uncanny resemblance to China's multi-pronged crackdown diktat, has given Russia's prosecutor general the power to take down sites that encourage mass riots, extremist activities, or participation in unsanctioned public events. It was under this law that Apple and Google were 
forced to remove
 a tactical voting app, which followers of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny used to express discontentment with the regime.


A few years later, the 2019 'sovereign internet law' 
gave 
government officials the power to pull the plug on the internet if needed.


By the end of 2021, Russian courts had already started 
targeting 
tech giants such as Alphabet, the parent company of Google, penalising it with a $98 million fine and Meta with a $27 million fine for repeatedly failing to delete illegal content. As Facebook and Twitter prepared to leave Russia, two subsidiaries from Russia's State-owned gas company 
Gazprom 
— Gazprom-Media and SOGAZ (insurance company) — took over the nation's largest social media network VKontakte, enabling direct State control over other networks.


In line with the Chinese model, the singular objective of Russian firewalling is to curtail dissent and strengthen the stability and legitimacy of the regime. But easy access to sensitive State information by actors like Huawei opens up a Pandora's Box of likely security breaches.


Huawei—shunned by West, resurrected by Kremlin


The deterioration in Russia's relations with the West after 2014 created new opportunities for Huawei. In retaliation to Western sanctions, Putin signed a series of laws aimed at technologically decoupling Russia from the West. As the Donald Trump administration 
imposed restrictions
 on Huawei in 2019, the technology corporation shifted its investments to Russia. It was launched after an agreement was 
signed
 between Xi and Putin.


Under Huawei's 
assistance
, Russia has started deploying mandatory black boxes. These systems intercept and monitor connections and collect data as required; they are also used by government agencies to block websites on the internet registry blacklist.


The Chinese tech giant has been 
instrumental
 in helping Russia make its own digital iron curtain, which is the cornerstone of Kremlin's strategy to 
perpetuate
 its narrative today.


A recent French report on 
China's influence operations
 revealed Huawei's close relationship with the CCP, and the latter's use of State-owned and private companies to collect vast amounts of data globally. This paints a vexing picture.


The first casualty of any war is truth. While the truth remains elusive and entwined with respective war aims, what is tangible is the development and deployment of State machinery in censoring information that dispute the State narrative. While no government can be completely absolved of not spying on citizens' information and communication, autocratic regimes do it with absolute authority and justification to a degree that is incomparable with their democratic counterparts.


India has already seen a 
surge
 in China-backed cyberattacks. Huawei and ZTE are under scrutiny in India for allegedly installing ‘backdoor' vulnerabilities to spy for the Chinese government. Does India have standalone capabilities lest Huawei's spying is rerouted through Russia's channels? Therein, perhaps, lies another lesson for New Delhi to fortify vital information.

8;How China Is Attempting to Control the ‘Information Pipes';;2023-03-03 13:45:09;full;https://thediplomat.com/2023/03/how-china-is-attempting-to-control-the-information-pipes/;thediplomat.com;In addition to beaming out its perspectives via Chinese state media, Beijing is aspiring to control both the structure and norms of global information networks.;"Advertisement
In the past decade, China's government has stepped up its efforts to wield powerful tools of information around the globe – in its near neighborhood and, increasingly in more distant places including North America, Africa, Latin America, and Europe. These tools include Beijing's own major state media outlets, like Xinhua, which have been expanded while China tries to make them credible, palatable alternatives to existing global newswires based in liberal democracies, like The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, Reuters, Kyodo, and others. It also includes Beijing's growing efforts to use proxies to control Chinese-language media outlets within other countries around the world, as well as Beijing's increasingly sophisticated use of disinformation on major social media platforms in its neighborhood and globally.
Yet even as China attempts to use the control over media and information it has amassed, it is also working to dominate the 'pipes' through which this information moves. I use the term 
pipes
 to mean the broad underpinnings of global information networks, including the actual physical infrastructure and the rules and norms that govern how information flows. More specifically, these pipes include the physical telecommunications networks for wireless and wired data; mobile phones and other devices that display information; tools that create the Internet of Things; tools that allow for surveillance; leading search engines, web browsers, and social media platforms; and the standards that govern the internet.
With greater influence in these areas, China would not have to rely as much on other countries to disseminate Xinhua, CGTN, and CRI, or on media coverage from local Chinese-language outlets controlled by Beijing. Instead, it could use its own pipes to more aggressively, and mostly covertly, spread state media coverage onto internet networks, social media platforms, mobile phones and other devices, browsers, and television conglomerates controlled by or closely linked to the Chinese government, which would deprive news consumers in many countries of independent coverage about China.
If Beijing had more control of the pipes of information, it also could, within foreign countries, more easily censor negative stories and social media conversations, and spread stories, rumors, opinions, accusations, blandishments, and other types of disinformation, obviously types of sharp power. Ultimately, it could use the pipes to help foreign countries copy China's surveillance strategies and to export China's vision of a closed and controlled domestic internet, part of Beijing's overall model of technology-enabled authoritarianism.

Chinese state companies are laying down many of the new physical or virtual pipes for global information flows in the developing world. The state-controlled China Telecom, for instance, has rolled out the third-biggest mobile phone network in the Philippines, despite concerns raised by security experts and some lawmakers about Beijing dominating a portion of the country's mobile infrastructure. China Telecom partnered with the tycoon Dennis Uy, a close ally of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, in obtaining and rolling out its mobile network. This is a strategy Chinese state firms have used in many countries. By partnering with local tycoons, Chinese firms often are able to land contracts to build mobile and fixed internet infrastructure, sometimes without any transparent bidding processes.
In Africa, Beijing has become by far the dominant builder of new physical infrastructure for the transmission of information. China Telecom and ZTE, whose biggest shareholder is a state-owned enterprise, are building the core of new mobile and fiber-optic networks across the African continent, competing largely with Huawei, which is a private Chinese company, but with historic links to the People's Liberation Army.
In return, they get help. Under China's Digital Silk Road (DSR) initiative, part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), many Chinese companies that build telecommunications infrastructure in Africa and other regions get loans from Chinese banks on extremely generous terms. Non-Chinese competitors face huge hurdles in corralling the same level of diplomatic support from their own governments or getting anything like the cheap financing, usually from Chinese state banks, that Chinese companies enjoy.

Huawei has signed numerous commercial contracts around the world to build next-generation 5G networks, though it has been shut out of many liberal democracies. Still, it is poised to be the dominant 5G provider in sub-Saharan Africa, with competitors lagging behind. In Southeast Asia, meanwhile, Huawei already has built many of the shorter undersea cables linking the region's telecommunications networks, and the company has inked deals to develop 5G networks in Cambodia, the Philippines, and Thailand – and possibly in Indonesia. And in the Pacific Islands, Huawei and other Chinese tech giants have competed aggressively with Australian and other companies to make new deals in places like Fiji. Around the world, Huawei is completing thousands of miles of undersea cable, through which most telecommunications traffic travels. In Central Asia, meanwhile, Huawei has already become the dominant provider of new 5G technology, including in the region's most populous state, Uzbekistan, and its freest, Kyrgyzstan.
Even in some democracies where leaders have significant concerns about allowing Chinese companies to build telecommunications infrastructure, Huawei has made inroads, although some of its efforts are now stalling in richer countries worried about the downsides of being reliant on Huawei and other Chinese tech firms. Yet Huawei's low costs and high levels of experience with technology often give them a leg up in getting contracts to build infrastructure, particularly in developing countries. Huawei also has become increasingly innovative, becoming one of the biggest investors in research and development of any tech company in the world.
Chinese firms are winning Internet of Things (IoT) contracts as well. Beijing has placed a particular priority on this sector since at least the late 2000s, when then-Premier Wen Jiabao declared it a national priority. Emily de La Bruyère and Nathan Picarsic, formerly of the consulting firm Long Term Strategy Group, have written that Chinese companies have built 'a network of sensors [in China] – including but not limited to surveillance cameras, car navigation systems, and smart electricity monitors.' Any information that is gathered is passed along to the China Academy of Sciences (CAS), a leading Chinese research institution. According to de La Bruyère and Picarsic, CAS 'explains that the system is a ‘test zone for a global network.''
Poland and other European states have given IoT contracts to Chinese companies, like the surveillance camera giant Hikvision, which is part of a massive state enterprise.  Chinese-built surveillance camera systems even have been used in official buildings in Europe and North America, including departments of the U.K. government and U.S. military bases, though they now have been banned. In 2019, the U.S. government added Hikvision and several other Chinese firms to an economic blacklist, in part due to their involvement in abuses in Xinjiang. (The Hikvision cameras were being used on U.S. bases right up until the ban.) But even these U.S. actions did not appear to stop the firms' global expansion.
Apps and Screens
Social media platforms are another kind of information pipe. A decade ago, Chinese companies had virtually no presence on social media. Since then, Chinese firms like WeChat, Weibo, and TikTok have expanded quickly, both at home and abroad.
TikTok, the short-video app, now rivals longer-established social media networks like Twitter and Instagram in terms of its number of new users, and is gaining massive cultural influence among preteens, teens, and young adults around the world. In 2021, it had the most downloads of any app, even though it was only launched globally in 2017.  The app has become omnipresent on the phones of high school and college students, with an estimated 40 percent of its users between the ages of 16 and 24.

TikTok's parent company, ByteDance Limited, presents itself as a global firm, and TikTok as no different from platforms run by U.S.-based companies like Facebook or Twitter. But these claims ring hollow, as multiple reports have found that TikTok has at times tried to alter or suppress content related to China, and as the Chinese government has taken a stake in ByteDance and gained an important seat on its board.
The China-based app WeChat also has begun to spread outside China. WeChat, owned by the Chinese conglomerate Tencent, has become a ubiquitous tool in China: Many middle-class Chinese have come to rely on it for much of their family, social, and work lives.
Usage of WeChat is spreading among Chinese speakers in every corner of the world. It has 1.24 billion users and it has expanded across Southeast Asia and South Asia. The United States, meanwhile, is believed to be the second largest-source of WeChat users, behind China. The Trump administration tried to crack down on it and its parent company with an executive order – but WeChat is still accessible, since the Biden administration rescinded plans to ban its service in the United States.

In Thailand, nearly 20 percent of the population uses the app.  In Malaysia, a country of around 32 million people, there are reportedly 20 million WeChat accounts. The app's group chats, which can include up to 500 people, are channels for the spread of information sympathetic to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), while people who offer critical commentary in the chat are censored. (While WeChat is not known primarily as a news app, its content often contains news stories, links to stories, and discussions about stories, making it a major disseminator of information about Chinese domestic and foreign policies.) In Northeast Asia, WeChat has become the second-most-popular messaging app in Mongolia, and is widely used in Japan and South Korea.
While Chinese social media platforms are spreading, Chinese mobile phone makers also are enjoying success, particularly in developing regions like Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. In these places, inexpensive Chinese phones have gained huge market shares, competing with more expensive rivals like Samsung and Apple. And because China was an early adapter in many new smartphone-related features like having one super app like WeChat, Chinese firms actually have surpassed non-Chinese rivals in developing many apps beloved by consumers, as well as developing specific innovations for markets in Africa and other developing regions.
The numbers do not lie. Today, China-based mobile phone companies make more than half of the phones purchased annually in Africa, including both smartphones and budget phones. In Southeast Asia, they are becoming increasingly popular, after garnering two-thirds of the market in India, a major geopolitical rival, and much of the market in China.
Many Chinese-made phones come loaded with the apps of the biggest Chinese social media platforms and web browsers, giving them an instant entrée to users in Africa, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and other regions, although they have also been accused of coming preloaded with spyware.
Chinese companies also are gaining ground in the global digital television market. They are no longer just copying foreign technologies but have become innovative and competitive. The Chinese pay television company StarTimes, for example, has become one of Africa's leading digital television operators. With its cheap TV packages and easy-to-install hardware, it can reach formerly unserved populations from Kenya to Nigeria to Rwanda.
'The pay TV company [i.e., StarTimes] is leading the continent's transition from analog to digital television with some of the world's most affordable cable/satellite TV packages priced as low as $4 per month. In the burgeoning Digital TV sector, StarTimes is far and away the market leader. The company's reach covers 90 percent of the continent's population,' wrote Eric Olander. StarTimes has announced nascent plans to expand its inexpensive services into Latin America as well.
Other large Chinese companies are entering the digital and satellite television markets in Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. ZTE has launched digital television services in Pakistan and is exploring other markets, while Chinese provincial and national state television networks are expanding into neighboring Southeast Asian cable markets like Laos, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam.
Influence Through Omission
By controlling the information pipes, Beijing can exert influence through omission. In other words, what does not appear about China in the media in other states can be as important as what does appear.
Beijing wants to silence conversations about many topics – Xinjiang, Tibet, the South China Sea, its  policies, and so on. It wants to make these tough topics disappear. And if they disappear for an extended period of time from media coverage and public conversations in other countries, that disappearance feeds on itself, creating a greater boon for China. Publics and opinion leaders do not learn about these issues sensitive to China; over time, publics and opinion leaders become less informed about these issues; with less information, they naturally speak and write about the topics less and less.
It is next to impossible for China to get positive coverage about these topics if they are covered openly and fairly. China could achieve this outcome, of course, through clear and open threats to punish other countries with economic measures, diplomatic measures, or other sanctions, for instance. But the bullying approach, though it certainly has worked with foreign companies and some foreign states fearful of being excluded from China's market or facing other sanctions from Beijing, has major downsides as well.
WeChat provides an opportunity for Beijing to help contain what appears in the news about China in other countries. As users outside China have gravitated to the app, including its popular messaging service, WeChat has become a central source of news for many Chinese-language speakers beyond the mainland. Wanning Sun, of the University of Technology Sydney, has found that while most Mandarin speakers in Australia do not get much of their news directly from Chinese state media, a majority of them do access WeChat and obtain news from it, such as from news shared in groups and messages. In fact, Sun found that about 60 percent of Mandarin speakers in Australia used WeChat as their primary source of news and information.

9;Chinese-EU digital cooperation is possible — but needs political will;Yan Shaohua;2023-01-05 06:00:03;full;https://euobserver.com/digital-eu/156481?utm_source=euobs&utm_medium=rss;euobserver.com;The EU and China have their differences but should reinvigorate their high-level digital dialogue and work together on building a better and more connected digital world.;"As other countries step up their efforts to promote digital innovation and rule-making, China has put forward the Digital Silk Road (DSR) as an integral part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), in a bid to try to improve digital infrastructure and narrow the digital gaps in countries which are part of the BRI.

While the digital world is widely-perceived to be dominated by the US and China, the EU is also seen by China as a global digital power with unique advantages. The EU's pursuit of ""digital sovereignty"" means more competition for China but it also presents opportunities for cooperation in areas where there are complementarities between China and the EU.

Student or retired? Then this plan is for you.

To tap the potential for cooperation, China and the EU have established a high-level digital dialogue, which provides a valuable platform for discussions between Brussels and Beijing on their respective approaches to digital transformation.

Despite the differences between China and the EU when it comes to terms like reciprocity, fairness and values, digitalisation remains one of the most promising areas for bilateral cooperation. It is thus necessary to identify priorities and new channels to move China-EU digital cooperation to the next level.

Digital innovation stands out as an area where China-EU cooperation could bring benefits to both sides. It is not only closely-related to investment in — and research of — a specific field, but also has a huge influence on the related high-tech industrial chains.

Volkswagen and 'automatic driving'

For instance, Volkswagen recently announced a €2.4bn investment to take a 60 percent stake in a joint venture with Horizon Robotics, a Chinese startup specializing in automatic driving and AI.

Incorporating the technologies of AI, deep-learning and perception-control, automatic driving represents a future trend of the automobile industry and provides a broad stage for China-EU cooperation in digital innovation.

Digital cooperation is also changing business models and market perceptions in China and Europe as online fashion houses expand their business. Meanwhile, New Energy Vehicles (NEV) play a central role in both digitalisation and decarbonisation that have topped the agenda in China and Europe over the past few years.

Despite growing competition, there has been excellent cooperation on NEV between China and the EU. China is now the world's largest NEV market, accounting for more than 60 percent of global sales volume. For European NEV companies and the related industrial chains, the Chinese market is key to their expansion. During the past decades, Chinese-EU cooperation in the automobile industry is largely a story of success, and this story should be continued in NEV industry.

There is also room for cooperation on digital rules and regulations. The EU is a leader in trans-border data flows and data protection. The GDPR adopted by the EU in 2016 has set a series of global standards for trans-border data flows, which also provide an example for China in creating and updating its regulatory frameworks in the digital world. Cooperation in digital rules and regulations would greatly benefit Chinese and Europe digital companies by connecting resources and markets on both sides.

In regulating cutting-edge technologies like AI, China and the EU face common challenges: of striking the right balance between civil rights, socio-economic development and national security. It is important that China and the EU could jointly develop the best practice in this regard.

The US sanctions imposed way back in 2018, and then again in 2020, continue to haunt Huawei. The company was forced to divest some business lines- including its mid-to low-end smartphone unit, Honor, and x86 server business - and its global standing in its ""crown jewel"" telecom equipment business has taken a hit.
These setbacks have sent Huawei into a tizzy as it reported its biggest-ever annual revenue drop of 28.6% in 2021. Though the revenue downtrend continued into 1H22, the pace of drop slowed down drastically. But that wasn't enough to contain net profit decline during the period, which more than halved as a difficult economy reduced demand from customers, intensifying woes brought by the US technology curbs.
Hard-pressed by the current turmoil, Huawei is betting big on cloud and supply chain independence to alleviate any further risks. The cloud focus emerges from the fact that there is no direct impact from the Entity List ruling on services and software. The company is already making notable strides in the cloud space, with its emergence as the second-biggest cloud provider after Alibaba in China.
Its strong cloud portfolio for the government sector is a big advantage, considering Huawei's experience working with provincial governments and state-owned enterprises in China. The other advantage is its overseas cloud data center footprint, which is in markets less directly impacted by US sanctions. Huawei is also an essential player engaged in China's global digital expansion initiative, ""Digital Silk Road"" (DSR), under its grand Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
To rebuild its supply chain, Huawei is aspiring to end-to-end home-grown innovation to power both its hardware- and cloud-related businesses. While its chip subsidiary, HiSilicon, designs data center server processors and chips for devices and telecom network equipment, it is seeking to ramp up production capabilities through a three-pronged strategy: build in-house chips, partner with domestic fabs, and invest in domestic chip startups.
Huawei's efforts to stage a comeback will depend on two aspects:
Cloud services business, which will be tasked to somewhat address the gap left by the severely hit hardware-based consumer division
Access to advanced chips that can take on the competition
The first aspect looks achievable as Huawei will be able to offer distinctive propositions such as synergies between its cloud offering and telecom equipment business, through its recently launched telco cloud solutions, coupled with a flexible collaboration model with the telcos.
The second aspect, though, could prove to be a stumbling block for Huawei, as technological capabilities achieved through homegrown chip manufacturing are years behind the capabilities possessed by Intel, TSMC, and Samsung. Until a solution to its advanced manufacturing shortcoming is figured out, Huawei will continue to rely on less-capable domestic fabs, which will put the company in survival mode for the next 3-4 years.
Further, Huawei is currently relying heavily on ARM for design of its data center server chips, which are central to the Huawei Cloud offering. There is some chance that the US will find a way to restrict ARM from working with Huawei, forcing the Chinese vendor to lean on RISC-V alternatives.

12;China's Tech Outreach in the Middle East and North Africa;;2022-11-17 15:45:00;timezone unknown;https://thediplomat.com/2022/11/chinas-tech-outreach-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa/;thediplomat.com;Chinese companies, acting out of both economic and geostrategic motives, are providing much of the MENA region's digital infrastructure.;"AdvertisementThe Middle East and North Africa region has become a hub for Chinese technological outreach. Over the years, Chinese entities have invested heavily in MENA's railways, ports, and the energy sector. However, absent an internet connection, software, and cybersecurity, much of this architecture would not be able to operate effectively.Enter Chinese Big Tech.Huawei provides communication technology for Morocco's national railway system (ONCF), has constructed a logistics center at Tangier Med Port, and was involved in building and launching the Marrakesh Safe City project. Roughly 7,000 kilometers away, the UAE's Cybersecurity Council inked a Memorandum of Understanding with Huawei at the GISEC 2022 cybersecurity conference in Dubai to collaborate in strengthening local cyber strategies. Meanwhile, governments and telecom companies in eight MENA countries have been working with Huawei to trial, develop, and roll out 5G. In 2021, Huawei committed to pumping $15 million into the Middle East's cloud computing market.And that's just one Chinese company out of dozens active in MENA.NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
Unlike traditional Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects that are often led by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), this Digital Silk Road (DSR) is being spearheaded by private tech companies that are primarily profit-driven.Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.Efforts by MENA nations to digitize and diversify their economies have made them attractive markets for these Chinese firms to expand their presence abroad. Draws for companies looking to enter the region include a relatively stable physical and digital infrastructure compared to other developing BRI regions, steadily growing internet penetration, and a digital economy projected to reach $400 billion by 2030.All this creates the impression that China-MENA technology cooperation is simply being driven by market forces. However, the logic driving China's engagement with the MENA region extends beyond the law of supply and demand and into the realm of geostrategy.Ubiquitous Connectivity AdvertisementIn a 2016 speech, China's top leader Xi Jinping said, 'We must encourage and support China's internet companies to go global … so as to achieve the principle of ‘wherever our national interests are, [our] informatization [technology] will also cover those areas.'' Through the DSR, China seeks to connect its civilian and military assets along the Belt and Road Initiative. The Pakistan & East Africa Connecting Europe fiber optic cable, or PEACE, exemplifies these efforts.PEACE travels from the BRI's flagship $62 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to Djibouti –where the Chinese military established a naval base in 2017. From there, it traverses the Bab al Mandab strait, a critical maritime choke point, and moves toward China-Egypt Teda Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone, where China has built a 7.34 sq km industrial estate. PEACE then travels through the Mediterranean and onward to Europe.Infrastructure like PEACE ensures that Chinese port operators enjoy the high-speed, low-latency connectivity critical for maintaining the integrity of supply chains and other activities that promote China's economic stability. Add to the mix that China, like other countries, relies on this vulnerable civilian infrastructure to coordinate military operations and Beijing's impetus to establish control over these networks should come as no surprise.Scholars like Zheng Anqi of the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology have directly linked military power with 'information power.' According to Zheng, 'The foundation of an information force is the network. Without the support of ubiquitous, broadband, and mobile networks, a powerful information army is just empty talk.'The 1996 Taiwan strait missile crisis illuminated precisely how a missing link in the technology stack can disrupt military operations when the PLA lost track of two missiles it fired into the East China Sea. Chinese military officers attributed the failure to a disruption in the U.S.-controlled Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) technology. Since then, China has worked hard to develop its own BeiDou Navigation Satellite System and has looked to MENA for cooperation partners.In 2017, the country launched the China-Arab States BeiDou Cooperation Forum. Shortly after the second forum concluded in Tunis in 2019, Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Defense and the Equipment Development Commission of China signed an MoU to cooperate in the military use of BeiDou. Admittedly, the data gathered from these satellites have applications that extend far beyond the military domain. For example, BeiDou has been deployed commercially in fields as diverse as environmental monitoring, smart agriculture, disaster relief, and transportation in Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Lebanon, Oman, and Morocco.Data as a Source of PowerEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.Much of the infrastructure along the Digital Silk Road is data-driven. Undersea cables, for instance, transmit more than 95 percent of global internet traffic and facilitate trillions of dollars in international financial transactions daily. Beyond the PEACE cable, Chinese companies like HMN tech (formerly Huawei Marine), China Telecom, and China Unicom have constructed, upgraded, or acquired ownership stakes in at least nine other cables traversing MENA.Meanwhile, companies like Shenzhen-based Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) have won hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts with U.S. allies like Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia. Thanks to these deals, BGI is now privy to reams of sensitive biological data.China has come to view data as a critical commodity and source of power. Key policy documents like the Action Plan to Promote the Development of Big Data (2015) and the 13th Five-Year-Plan (2016) designate data as 'a foundational strategic resource' alongside land, labor, and capital. The Action Plan calls for the country to 'comprehensively advance the development and application of big data' and 'accelerate the construction of a strong data country.' Beijing has since created legal frameworks for companies to provide data to the central government on national security grounds.AdvertisementAnalysts have since raised concerns that data collected along China's Digital Silk Road may help China manipulate political perceptions, spread authoritarianism, and undermine democracy. The opaque public-private sector nexus and the ambiguity surrounding what constitutes ‘national security grounds' have only reinforced these fears.Countering US Containment Against the backdrop of renewed great power competition, Beijing has come to view its technology cooperation with MENA as increasingly important in countering U.S. efforts to contain China's rising power and influence. Since 2018, the United States has succeeded in persuading many firms and allied nations worldwide to 'decouple' from Chinese technology and supply chains. That year, Chinese investment and infrastructure projects declined in every region – except the Middle East and North Africa.The flow of capital is also slowly becoming more bi-directional: Oil-rich Gulf countries are now investing in China's high-end manufacturing, advanced technology, and research and development. For example, when Jaka Robotics, a Chinese startup that makes collaborative robots, pulled in a Series D funding round of over $150 million in July 2022, a growth fund under Saudi Aramco Ventures was among the lead investors. Two months later, the Saudi Company for Artificial Intelligence (SCAI) announced it would inject around $206 million into a joint venture with China's SenseTime to build a state-of-the-art AI lab and advance Saudi Arabia's AI-tech ecosystem.In its quest to dominate the strategic technologies of tomorrow, China has also turned to MENA nations to acquire digital innovations and know-how. Israel's vibrant innovation ecosystem has become a prime target in this regard. Since 2002 the vast majority of Chinese investments and M&A deals in Israel have been in the tech sector – over $9 billion worth. Through these deals, Huawei acquired Israeli cybersecurity startup Hexatier for $42 million and IT company Toga Networks for over $100 million. Today, Toga employs over 350 leading experts and continues to serve as a Huawei R&D center.With 9,547 active high-tech companies, Israel is undoubtedly the most enticing source of innovative technologies in the region. But when it comes to Chinese R&D partnerships, Beijing has looked beyond Israel's 'Silicon Wadi.' Huawei has set up OpenLabs in Cairo, Dubai, and Istanbul to develop innovations in cloud computing, big data, smart cities, and other core technologies. The facility in Turkey is Huawei's largest overseas R&D operation and receives over $20 million annually in funding.Beyond Huawei, 2018 saw Alibaba Cloud and the UAE's Khalifa University of Science and Technology agree to launch a Joint Innovation Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence for Clean Energy. That same year the UAE's International Center for Biosaline Agriculture in the United Arab Emirates partnered with BGI to establish an advanced genomics center.China Wins TwiceOn the face of it, these partnerships appear a win-win. However, an April 2022 study by political economy researcher Tin Hinane El Kadi suggests that this is not always the case. In her examination of Huawei's localization efforts in Algeria and Egypt, El Kadi notes that Huawei often 'engaged in training, manufacturing, and R&D in a way designed to maintain the firm's technological edge' and 'without engaging in meaningful capacity building.'To qualify: not all Chinese technology systems are malignant. Moreover, there are immense economic and social benefits to cooperating with China in the digital realm, including enhanced industrial efficiency, job creation, better access to education, crime reduction, improved road safety, and more financial inclusion. Chinese companies offer cutting-edge technology at an affordable price, and China doesn't condition cooperation on democratizing or liberalizing local institutions.Regardless of these perceived benefits, pundits and policymakers would be naive to ignore the geostrategic dimensions of China's technology outreach. In a May 2021 speech before hundreds of the nation's elite scientists gathered in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, Xi Jinping himself declared: 'Technological innovation has become the main battlefield of the international strategic game.' MENA countries are part of this game, whether they acknowledge it or not.As MENA nations become ever more reliant on Chinese technology systems, Beijing is accruing leverage and influence.

The US sanctions imposed way back in 2018, and then again in 2020, continue to haunt Huawei. The company was forced to divest some business lines- including its mid-to low-end smartphone unit, Honor, and x86 server business - and its global standing in its ""crown jewel"" telecom equipment business has taken a hit.

These setbacks have sent Huawei into a tizzy as it reported its biggest-ever annual revenue drop of 28.6% in 2021. Though the revenue downtrend continued into 1H22, the pace of drop slowed down drastically. But that wasn't enough to contain net profit decline during the period, which more than halved as a difficult economy reduced demand from customers, intensifying woes brought by the US technology curbs.

Hard-pressed by the current turmoil, Huawei is betting big on cloud and supply chain independence to alleviate any further risks. The cloud focus emerges from the fact that there is no direct impact from the Entity List ruling on services and software. The company is already making notable strides in the cloud space, with its emergence as the second-biggest cloud provider after Alibaba in China. Its strong cloud portfolio for the government sector is a big advantage, considering Huawei's experience working with provincial governments and state-owned enterprises in China. The other advantage is its overseas cloud data center footprint, which is in markets less directly impacted by US sanctions. Huawei is also an essential player engaged in China's global digital expansion initiative, ""Digital Silk Road"" (DSR), under its grand Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

To rebuild its supply chain, Huawei is aspiring to end-to-end home-grown innovation to power both its hardware- and cloud-related businesses. While its chip subsidiary, HiSilicon, designs data center server processors and chips for devices and telecom network equipment, it is seeking to ramp up production capabilities through a three-pronged strategy: build in-house chips, partner with domestic fabs, and invest in domestic chip startups.

Huawei's efforts to stage a comeback will depend on two aspects:


Cloud services business, which will be tasked to somewhat address the gap left by the severely hit hardware-based consumer division


Access to advanced chips that can take on the competition


The first aspect looks achievable as Huawei will be able to offer distinctive propositions such as synergies between its cloud offering and telecom equipment business, through its recently launched telco cloud solutions, coupled with a flexible collaboration model with the telcos.

The second aspect, though, could prove to be a stumbling block for Huawei, as technological capabilities achieved through homegrown chip manufacturing are years behind the capabilities possessed by Intel, TSMC, and Samsung. Until a solution to its advanced manufacturing shortcoming is figured out, Huawei will continue to rely on less-capable domestic fabs, which will put the company in survival mode for the next 3-4 years. Further, Huawei is currently relying heavily on ARM for design of its data center server chips, which are central to the Huawei Cloud offering. There is some chance that the US will find a way to restrict ARM from working with Huawei, forcing the Chinese vendor to lean on RISC-V alternatives.

During the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) international cooperation summit forum in 2017, Chinese President Xi Jinping had proposed to enhance cooperation with Pakistan in vast areas of digital economy, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and quantum computing, reported Islam Khabar. There were a few attractive takeaways for Pakistan in China's DSR pitch. However Pakistan needs to look into its broken digital architecture which is not in alignment with China's Digital Silk Road hopes. There is a wide gap in Pakistan's digital progress in terms of gender. There are cultural barriers and terrorism. All of this is a setback for Pakistan. Though China has sold dreams to Pakistan under DSR there are hard facts which prove that the plan is farfetched. Pakistan's overall GDP is USD 280 billion and the per capita GDP of less than USD 1,400, according to World Bank data 2021. With this low level of an economic base, the situation is wary for Pakistan to be able to play a similar kind of role as China in the DSR project. Pakistan and China may target for same goals but the ground reality continues to be in stark contrast. Be it economic development, digital infrastructure, internet penetration and the size of online commerce– all of these parameters are very different for each of the countries. The digital gender gap in Pakistan's society is particularly striking. It is mainly attributed to low level of female literacy, insufficient ICT skills and low affordability. In 2021, Pakistan had more than 100 million mobile broadband subscribers of which only 21 million were females, reported Islam Khabar. Female usage of digital services are not same as that of the male counterpart. There is perceived safety and security and households do not approve of the use of the internet by females. This makes women's participation in digital activities small. There are about 46 million social media users in the country, with male facebook users being five times more than female ones; indicating a 70 PC gender gap here, according to the data quotes by the media portal. According to State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data, only 29 per cent of adult women have a bank account, 25 per cent have a cell phone. Only 18 per cent of the women have a corresponding digital bank account and the gender gap indigital finance stands at 64 per cent. Even though Pakistan is trying to move towards digital economy, cash remains the primary mode of payment. Almost all retailers and suppliers feels that cash transactions are safer than online ones. Most wages and salaries are still being paid in cash. This is created a significant hurdle in giving an impetus to the digital economy.

The US-China strategic rivalry extends to the struggle for control over the digital economy — particularly digital infrastructure and technological innovation. China's digital economy is among the most vibrant in the world, ranking in 2021 at US$7.1 trillion. And it has become a crucial part of the relations between China and Gulf states including Bahrain, Kuwait, Iraq, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The energy sector is still the largest recipient of Chinese investment in most Gulf countries. China's crude oil imports originate from just nine Middle Eastern nations. Beijing's oil and gas imports, infrastructure investment and arms sales give it regional influence that runs counter to the United States. The Gulf state economies have historically depended on energy exports for economic prosperity.

But the rise of digital technologies over the past decade has seen Gulf states diversify their economies by developing financial sectors and knowledge-based industries. That means digital cooperation between China and Gulf states could be a game-changer for Beijing in its competition with the United States to achieve strategic superiority in the region.

The joint development of telecommunications, smart cities, artificial intelligence and technology-oriented businesses is a complementary endeavor for China and Gulf states. The young population of the Gulf is exposed to the growing presence of Chinese technology, ranging from social networking applications to digital payment platforms.

The Digital Silk Road (DSR) is the technological arm of the Belt and Road Initiative. The DSR Initiative has the potential to add $255 billion to regional GDP and create 600,000 technology-related jobs in Gulf Cooperation Council countries . Still, DSR-related projects remain unevenly distributed among the Gulf states.

Tech giants have a role in delivering China's DSR initiative and continuing the digital development of the region. Huawei is working with Saudi Arabia to develop digital infrastructure for religious pilgrimages. The firm has also partnered with Dubai officials to help update its airport and cooperated with the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority to build fiber optics and video surveillance.

In 2022, the UAE telecommunications company, Du, signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Huawei to research, verify and replicate multi-access edge computing applications in the region. That includes leveraging 5G multi-access edge computing applications to live broadcast the Presidential Cycling Cup.

Huawei received permission to offer cloud computing services in in July 2022. Alibaba has since pledged to build a'Tech Town' with Meraas Holding, a Dubai-based developer, housing over 3,000 high-tech companies. Alibaba has also inked deals to store cloud data in Oman and has a vast .

Chinese artificial intelligence company SenseTime opened a regional headquarters in Abu Dhabi in 2019. Abu Dhabi Global Market and the Hong Kong Securities and Exchange have recently worked together to foster financial services innovation in Hong Kong and the UAE.

Saudi firm M/s Aramco Asia is in negotiations to sign an MoU with Chinese firm Avic International on drone services and technology development. Chinese telecom firm Huawei is also trying to bid for the expansion of data processing centers in Dammam and Riyadh.

Chinese tech giants have notably participated in developing 5G networks in Gulf states. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait were the first Gulf states to construct 5G networks. By 2019, the UAE 5G network covered 80% of its cities, and Huawei had deployed more than 1,000 5G sites across Kuwait.

has led Washington to pressure Gulf states into picking sides. The United States perceives certain aspects of their digital cooperation with China as damaging to its national security. The Gulf states are aware of US concerns about China's regional presence and they want to avoid getting caught in a great power conflict.

Despite doubts about Washington's commitment to their security, Gulf states recognize that there is no substitute for the US military presence to block Iranian aggression.

Gulf states are trying to diversify their economic and military support to avoid absolute dependence on Washington or Beijing. Picking sides risks the Gulf states losing their security partnership with the United States or their technological partnership with China.

The US military presence in the Gulf suggests a degree of military interdependence between the United States and Gulf states. China does not have the same ability to project global military power as it lacks global reach, foreign defense treaties and overseas military bases.

Nor does China have the money to replace Washington as the security guarantor of the Persian Gulf despite the United States proving itself to be an increasingly unreliable partner. That adds to the impossible situation facing the Gulf states as they balance their vital security partnership with the United States alongside burgeoning digital ties with China.

But the extent to which Gulf states can engage in economic or technological collaboration with China is a function of US pressure. Washington's calls to slow the proliferation of Chinese technologies complicate the commercial environment for Chinese firms.

China might, in response, use diplomatic and economic pressure to promote itself at the expense of the United States — making it hard for the Gulf States to maintain parallel partnerships.

In an era of geostrategic rivalry, Washington expects its Gulf allies to make stark and brutal choices. Gulf states must manage their digital ties with China while understanding that Washington's concerns place limitations on their new technological partnerships.

The DSR Initiative has the potential to add $255 billion to regional GDP and create 600,000 technology-related jobs in Gulf Cooperation Council countries by 2030. Still, DSR-related projects remain unevenly distributed among the Gulf states. Tech giants have a role in delivering China's DSR initiative and continuing the digital development of the region. Huawei is working with Saudi Arabia to develop digital infrastructure for religious pilgrimages. The firm has also partnered with Dubai officials to help update its airport and cooperated with the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority to build fiber optics and video surveillance.

Photo: Xinhua / Wang Haizhou In 2022, the UAE telecommunications company, Du, signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Huawei to research, verify and replicate multi-access edge computing applications in the region. That includes leveraging 5G multi-access edge computing applications to live broadcast the Presidential Cycling Cup. Huawei received permission to offer cloud computing services in Kuwait in July 2022. Alibaba has since pledged to build a 'Tech Town' with Meraas Holding, a Dubai-based developer, housing over 3,000 high-tech companies. Alibaba has also inked deals to store cloud data in Oman and has a vast e-commerce footprint in Saudi Arabia.
 Chinese artificial intelligence company SenseTime opened a regional headquarters in Abu Dhabi in 2019. Abu Dhabi Global Market and the Hong Kong Securities and Exchange have recently worked together to foster financial services innovation in Hong Kong and the UAE. Saudi firm M/s Aramco Asia is in negotiations to sign an MoU with Chinese firm Avic International on drone services and technology development. Chinese telecom firm Huawei is also trying to bid for the expansion of data processing centers in Dammam and Riyadh. Chinese tech giants have notably participated in developing 5G networks in Gulf states. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait were the first Gulf states to construct 5G networks. By 2019, the UAE 5G network covered 80% of its cities, and Huawei had deployed more than 1,000 5G sites across Kuwait. China's growing regional presence has led Washington to pressure Gulf states into picking sides. The United States perceives certain aspects of their digital cooperation with China as damaging to its national security. The Gulf states are aware of US concerns about China's regional presence and they want to avoid getting caught in a great power conflict. Despite doubts about Washington's commitment to their security, Gulf states recognize that there is no substitute for the US military presence to block Iranian aggression. 
 Gulf states are trying to diversify their economic and military support to avoid absolute dependence on Washington or Beijing. Picking sides risks the Gulf states losing their security partnership with the United States or their technological partnership with China. The US military presence in the Gulf suggests a degree of military interdependence between the United States and Gulf states. China does not have the same ability to project global military power as it lacks global reach, foreign defense treaties and overseas military bases. Nor does China have the money to replace Washington as the security guarantor of the Persian Gulf despite the United States proving itself to be an increasingly unreliable partner. That adds to the impossible situation facing the Gulf states as they balance their vital security partnership with the United States alongside burgeoning digital ties with China.

US influence in the Middle East continues to decline. Photo: AFP / Ahmad al-Rubaye But the extent to which Gulf states can engage in economic or technological collaboration with China is a function of US pressure. Washington's calls to slow the proliferation of Chinese technologies complicate the commercial environment for Chinese firms. China might, in response, use diplomatic and economic pressure to promote itself at the expense of the United States — making it hard for the Gulf States to maintain parallel partnerships.
 In an era of geostrategic rivalry, Washington expects its Gulf allies to make stark and brutal choices. Gulf states must manage their digital ties with China while understanding that Washington's concerns place limitations on their new technological partnerships.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for China to dominate advanced technology manufacturing by 2025. The Digital Silk Road (DSR), launched in 2015 as part of the Belt and Road Initiative, reflects this goal of developing digital infrastructure at home and overseas. The world has witnessed China's digital transformation in telecommunications, artificial intelligence, satellite navigation systems, sea cables and surveillance systems. The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the DSR, increasing China's digital projects and high-tech investment abroad.
 Chinese technology firms have a significant presence in the Middle East and North Africa. Industry commentators have described Huawei as the world's largest telecommunications supplier, second largest smartphone manufacturer and a global leader in fifth-generation (5G) telecommunication networks. Since 2018, Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Baidu have invested heavily in regional commerce and telecommunications. Huawei became one of the first fully-owned technology companies in Qatar in 2018, contributing to the development of 5G technology and providing better communication between individuals, vehicles and appliances. In 2019, Huawei signed a partnership agreement with Saudi Arabia's leading telecommunications provider Zain to launch the first 5G local area network in the Middle East and North Africa. United Arab Emirates telecommunication companies Du and Etisalat have also signed deals with Huawei to provide 5G network services.

Photo: Xinhua In 2017, Huawei launched the Cairo OpenLab to serve as a hub for conducting research and development (R&D) in North Africa and established partnerships with many universities in the region to train local students. In Tunisia and Algeria, China has used its BeiDou Navigation Satellite System in agriculture, telecommunications, maritime monitoring and disaster relief. China is seeking a greater technological presence through the DSR in many regions — making it difficult for Western companies to compete. In the post-pandemic era, the Middle East and North Africa will be more dependent on China, especially in the digital telecommunications industry. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, connectivity has become more prominent. Similar to the rest of the world, the use of the internet for online education, shopping and health services has become essential for daily life in the region. Inequality in internet access remains a critical challenge across the region, especially in countries with poorer infrastructure capabilities. The number of internet users in the region exceeded 300 million in 2021, with internet penetration due to reach 50% of the population by the end of 2022.
 Affordability is one of the major factors behind the spread of Chinese smartphones in the region. Phone brands such as Vivo, Oppo and Xiaomi are increasingly popular choices for consumers. Competition between Chinese phones and other brands is limited due to the cheaper price and 5G technology offered by Chinese brands. Implementing Chinese technology in the Middle East and North Africa will not only improve countries' economies but will also contribute to improvements in education, health, transportation, agriculture and services. The adoption of Chinese technology will also have economic and political implications for the region. On the economic front, China is expanding its technological firms, creating more opportunities for China to dominate the digital market in the region. That may affect the ability of local and Western companies to compete. On the political front, the internet was an important tool used to fight autocratic regimes during the Arab Spring in 2011. As politicians in the region have become aware that the internet poses a potential threat to their power, the level of internet censorship has intensified. Moroccan protestors cry out for reform. The February 20 movement was born during the so-called Arab Spring. Photo: AFP / Fadel Senna The DSR is an attractive idea to many countries looking to improve their economic growth and work towards digital transformation. But the security challenges behind engaging with China in this sector remain a critical issue.
 Data security is a key concern for countries that are using Chinese technology. Huawei has helped roll out surveillance systems across Africa and was accused of helping African governments spy on citizens for political reasons in 2019. As China develops stronger political and economic ties with countries in the Middle East and North Africa, policymakers must consider the implications of adopting Chinese technological systems. Given the region's history of political suppression, these systems could be used to hinder political freedom.

21;Digital Dynasties: How China's Cryptocurrency Could Unseat the Dollar;Sam Davidson Is A Staff Writer;2022-08-29 13:00:00;full;https://hir.harvard.edu/digital-dynasties-how-chinas-cryptocurrency-could-unseat-the-dollar/;harvard.edu;"""Although the US dollar remains the world's dominant fiat currency, an analysis of the geopolitics surrounding the battle for currency hegemony reveals that China's digital yuan will pose a serious…";Nearly 900 years ago, China's Song dynasty government, at the time the most advanced civilization in the world, issued the world's first centralized paper currency. When Marco Polo encountered money made from the 'bark of trees' circulating universally within the Mongol empire during the Yuan Dynasty, one hundred years later, he witnessed a financial system with efficient, long distance transactions, and a central banking authority with the complete trust of the population. Today, the world is on the cusp of another technological revolution in how humans conduct commerce. Again, China is at the fore, leading the way from cash to cryptocurrency with a new central bank digital currency (CBDC), the e-CNY, commonly known as the digital yuan. Although the US dollar remains the world's dominant fiat currency, an analysis of the geopolitics surrounding the battle for currency hegemony reveals that China's digital yuan will pose a serious challenge to the dollar status quo as the 21st century unfolds.The Digital YuanChina's 13th Five Year Plan, covering 2016 through 2020, aimed to 'promote RMB [Chinese currency] internationalization and see RMB capital go global.' China's motivations for RMB internationalization include escaping US monetary policy, shoring up against dollar shortages, and gaining lower borrowing costs. From 2009 to 2019, 20 trillion yuan were exchanged across borders. Still, the RMB makes up a mere two percent of global foreign reserves compared to the dollar's sixty percent. The basic prerequisite for any reserve currency is the backing of a large economy, a high trade volume, and a net creditor status (meaning a country's international investments are larger than the foreign debt they owe). China lags just behind the United States in GDP and trade volume and is a fifteen percent net creditor compared to the United States' eighty percent net debtor position. Beyond pure economic calculus, however, currency hegemony relies on a balance of factors that still remain squarely in favor of the dollar. Crucially, China's rule of law, trustworthiness, and tightly controlled economy make investors skittish of relying on Chinese currency. What, then, is China's path to an internationally formidable RMB?The answer may lie in China's digital yuan. The cryptocurrency has been in development for over eight years, since the People's Bank of China (PBoC) began investigating a government-run bitcoin in 2014. In the early 2010s, Chinese crypto miners were responsible for an estimated 95 percent of all newly minted bitcoin. The Chinese government discovered this mining activity in 2012 after investigating suspicious power usage, as bitcoin mining is extremely energy intensive. A decentralized, anonymous currency posed a major threat to China's strict social and financial controls. As officials started banning and regulating cryptocurrency, they also saw its potential. By 2021, all private cryptocurrency activity was banned and the Chinese economy had also largely transitioned away from paper yuan. Last year, 80 percent of Chinese adults made digital payments. Testing for the digital yuan began in 2020, but the early adoption numbers were less encouraging than Chinese officials may have hoped for. By October 2021, there were a total of 123 million individual wallets, although the average sum in each was just 47 cents (three RMB) implying that many consumers weren't actively using the new currency. Adoption numbers then doubled by January 2022 in the lead-up to the Winter Olympics hosted in Beijing. China planned to use the Olympics to introduce the world to the digital yuan, similar to the country's extravagant displays in 2008 that thrust a modern China onto the global stage. Due to China's stringent covid policies, few foreign visitors were actually in attendance. Still, the PBoC reported around $300,000 (2 million RMB) in daily transactions with the digital yuan throughout the games. Although dwarfed domestically by China's primary digital payment companies, AliPay and TenPay, China's ambitions for the digital yuan are undoubtedly international. The Geopolitics of Currency HegemonyThe battle for currency hegemony is better characterized as an insurgency than a Cold War, and China may be willing to employ geopolitical tactics to outmaneuver the current-standing hegemon. There are three primary ways that China could leverage its geopolitical clout to achieve RMB internationalization through the digital yuan.The first and strongest lever available to China is the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Announced in 2013 as Xi Jinping's capstone foreign policy project, the BRI has a projected lifetime spending of over one trillion dollars. The initiative consists of both an overland economic belt and a maritime silk road and encompasses an estimated 60 countries that comprise two-thirds of the world's population. The domestic goals of the BRI are largely economic. China has an overcapacity of raw materials such as steel and coal and producers are desperate for new export markets. The BRI also aims to economically develop impoverished regions in western China as a part of trade routes planned through central Asia. The economic goals alone do not justify the initiative's price tag, however, and the foreign policy ambitions inherent in the BRI are vast.Regionally, China hopes to counter the U.S. 'pivot to Asia' which started under the Obama Administration's strengthening of economic ties with neighboring countries and fostering of new investment opportunities. Globally, China aims to finance infrastructure spending in developing countries, thus currying favor and potentially gaining political leverage in recipient nations. This practice, sometimes referred to as 'debt-trap diplomacy,' has recently been criticized for contributing to Sri Lanka's economic crisis.China is also planning to use the BRI to internationalize the RMB. Indeed, the majority of BRI project recipients showed interest in settling cross-border transactions using RMB. This is where the digital yuan comes in. According to researcher Mahima Duggal, The BRI is a 'perfect mechanism for accelerating the international use of a digital yuan.' In many developing countries, banking infrastructure is severely lacking and transactions can take weeks. The digital yuan bypasses any third-party banks or local institutions and practically eliminates fees while executing transactions instantly. Stanley Chao, an expert on business in Asia, says that many countries within the BRI would 'jump at the idea' of adopting a digital yuan. Another facet of the BRI is the Digital Silk Road (DSR), which aims to export Chinese technology to BRI participants including high speed internet, artificial intelligence, and mobile payment systems similar to China's own AliPay. With Chinese technology comes Chinese control, as many technology firms in China are only nominally in the private sector. With greater control of a country's digital infrastructure and widespread use of a digital yuan, Duggal writes that China could even 'rewire the financial networks' in countries heavily involved with the BRI.China's BRI is primarily a foreign policy outreach program aimed at developing new allies and gaining influence in emerging markets. But for a project as ambitious as currency hegemony, China is also turning to old allies to help implement an international CBDC. A majority of countries that are members of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are currently investigating a CBDC or have already developed one. Many of these CBDCs are limited to domestic use, but China is one of the first countries seriously evaluating cross-border transactions using a CBDC, a crucial first step towards global adoption. Their experimentation has spawned the multiple CBDC, or mCBDC, bridge project, a collaboration between four financial jurisdictions—China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and the UAE—that aims to create infrastructure to facilitate efficient, low cost transfers between CBDCs while respecting existing regulations and privacy norms within each jurisdiction. The project identified 15 use cases of CBDC transfers between countries including commercial payments, wealth management, bond issuance, trade settlements, and supply chain financing. Several of the financial institutions participating in the mCBDC such as Goldman Sachs (US), HSBC (UK), and UBS (Switzerland), are based in western economies. This potentially indicates a broader reach for collaboration than simply Chinese allies and regional banks.Lastly, international sanctions present a unique opportunity for China to showcase the advantages of a currency outside of US control. When Russia invaded Ukraine, one way the United States retaliated was by cutting Russia off from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT). SWIFT is responsible for nearly all international cross-border transactions. As 95 percent of all dollar payments are settled in New York, SWIFT is policed by the US. The White House vowed that without SWIFT, Russia would be reliant on 'the telephone or a fax machine' to conduct international business. The digital yuan offers a potential solution. By bypassing SWIFT and executing a secure cross-border transfer using China's CBDC, Russia could theoretically trade with anyone willing to run afoul of US sanctions. If China itself were the target of widespread sanctions, the digital yuan could be crucial to continuing trade relations with close allies. China could also pitch the digital yuan to any countries seeking to disrupt US hegemony, such as its ally Iran. More support for the digital yuan increases its reach and recognition, in turn boosting the internationalization of the RMB. Playing Catch-upRegardless of the present shortcomings of China's CBDC experimentation, the United States may be too far behind in producing a viable competitor. After the digital yuan had already debuted on the international stage in March 2022, Biden issued an executive order to begin investigating a US CBDC. Although the United States is a dominant market player in privately traded cryptocurrencies, it has not spent the past decade seriously researching and testing CBDCs as China has. There is some hope, as early versions of a US CBDC being developed in conjunction with MIT have proven more sophisticated than the digital yuan, being able to handle over five times more transactions per second. This technology is still far from being traded across borders, however. For now, as the Vice President of a Beijing-based cryptocurrency firm Ian Wittkop writes, CBDCs are 'a field of one.' In our post-pandemic world, with trends such as e-commerce, social media, and remote work, it is clear that the world is becoming more and more digital. A financial system dominated by CBDCs and, by extension, China, could become an inevitable reality.;harvard.edu;91;news;US;en;Fdi In Emerging Markets,Global Urbanization.,Sam Davidson,Sam Davidson Is A Staff Writer;https://hir.harvard.edu/content/images/2022/08/matt-zhang-uVWGOO4c1VQ-unsplash-2.jpg;False;@HarvardIR;20.79361;e7352f4b4d75bf98b34ecd9443969af9;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND DSR', 'lang': 'en', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'from': '3 years ago', 'sort_by': 'date', 'page': 1}

So far, China has been leading this contest. Many experts consider China's plan for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) as a highly progressive and civic step that other counties ought to follow. The European Central Bank (ECB) has already announced its plans to launch a pilot program within two years. Especially, the United States is worried that the digital yuan will pose a threat to the dollar's dominance. Sinophobia could be defined as anti-Chinese sentiment and a kind of antagonism against China and Chinese culture. The pandemic has recently triggered a new wave of Sinophobia. Historians state that American Sinophobia dates back to the 1880s when the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed. This law banned Chinese immigrants from entering the U.S. at the time. Former U.S. President Donald Trump's constant accusations against China for COVID-19 worsened the situation in the U.S. The concept of Sinophobia has been more related to trade wars, media, proxy wars and especially economics nowadays. The worsening political, economic and social relationship between the U.S. and China has been at the forefront of the media. A recently published report from the Pew Research Center reveals that 73% of Americans have an unfavorable view of China. This ratio was 47% in 2018. This, therefore, means that Sinophobia exists on both governmental and public levels. China's digital yuan seems to be the most prominent reason behind Sinophobia currently. So, is the digital asset a threat to the West or a progressive move in the transformation of traditional fiat money? While the People's Bank of China (PBoC) has stated that the alleged objective of minting a digital yuan is to lessen transaction costs and bring efficiency into payments, the West claims that the real intent of introducing a digital yuan is to intensify state authority of the payments system and to monitor transactions and even personal behavior. Chinese yuan (e-CNY), which is known as the digital currency and electronic payment (DCEP) system, has been under scrutiny for a while. Pilot programs have been set up in big cities and, in June, a lottery was held to pay out 40 million yuan ($6.2 million) in digital cash. Residents of the city joined the lottery by using two banking apps for the opportunity to win one of the 200,000 digital yuan 'red packets,' each worth about $31, which could be utilized for shopping at certain business points. Whereas the Chinese government is proud that it is moving toward a cashless society, some economists think otherwise. Cornell economist Eswar Prasad's new book titled ""The Future of Money: How the Digital Revolution Is Transforming Currencies and Finance"" warns about the role of central bank digital currencies in non-democratic societies. The book informs that, 'In authoritarian societies, central bank money in digital form could become an additional instrument of government control over citizens rather than just a convenient, safe and stable medium of exchange.' The U.S. also is concerned about digital colonialism and it has some solid reasons. Launched in 2015, the Digital Silk Road (DSR) is a part of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The project urges Chinese companies to spread the construction of digital infrastructure and integrate communications technology (ICT) markets in countries that take part in the BRI. The U.S. regards this project as a sinister way to force the adoption of the digital yuan, thus increasing the Chinese control in the Western financial system. The U.S. government has recently asked the EU counties to abandon the project. The outstanding Chinese company Huawei is also under pressure. In spite of the increased regulatory scrutiny from the EU and U.S., Huawei signed 90 agreements in the first two months of the year and almost 50 of these were signed with European companies. Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer at the Human Rights Foundation (HRF), has revealed the dangers of the CBDC to financial freedom and privacy, especially in authoritarian regimes like China. Digital yuan is designed for domestic use, not cross-border transactions, at least initially. The Western axis claim that the dollar has this unique status as a safe-haven currency as it is supported by the U.S. institutions that preserve fundamental freedoms and human rights. Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), has recently said that a digital dollar would be useful for the world economy. It is clear that the digital yuan will pose a risk to dollar dominance in the long term. As China and Eurasian countries get more politically and financially powerful, China will do its best to expand its digital yuan in Africa, the Middle East, Asia and elsewhere. Some experts believe that the digital yuan is a perfect achievement that indicates the power and superiority of China in financial technology while the U.S. government considers the digital yuan as a secret weapon.

Much focus, of course, has been on how PGII will be an alternative mechanism to China's multitrillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), launched almost 10 years ago as a modern-day Silk Road stretching from East Asia to Europe and Africa. PGII is not exactly new: It is a repackaged version of the Build Back Better World (B3W) initiative the G7 proposed a year ago with the same aim to counter China's growing influence, especially in developing countries. Biden stressed the PGII's tangible and political dimensions when he emphasised that it will not only 'deliver returns for everyone"" but would also allow countries to ""see the concrete benefits of partnering with democracies"". PGII RESPONSE TO EMERGING CHALLENGES LIKE CLIMATE AND ENERGY Why now? At first glance, PGII may look better positioned to respond to emerging challenges of a world that has changed in the near-decade since BRI began. It aims to focus on climate and energy security and the development of soft infrastructure in the digital economy, among other things. Flagship projects include a US$600 million global submarine telecommunications cable connecting Singapore to France through Egypt and the Horn of Africa; a US$40 million investment (and expected to mobilise US$2 billion in further investments) in Southeast Asia's Smart Power Program to accelerate rollout of clean energy technologies; and a US$2 billion solar project in southern Angola.

 The PGII will find a receptive audience in this region, given the ever-growing appetite for infrastructure among Southeast Asian countries. Digital infrastructure is particularly important as a key part of ASEAN's digital masterplan is to technologically transform member states into a digital economy and a digital society by 2025. According to a recent Google-led survey, ASEAN's digital economy is on track to grow to US$1 trillion by 2030, particularly in e-commerce and virtual finance domains. Given Southeast Asia's severe vulnerability to climate change, green infrastructure is another area of interest. ASEAN states signed the 2015 Paris Agreement and its Community Vision 2025 specifically recognised the complementarity between the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and ASEAN's community-building endeavours. South Korean manufacturing giants who have shifted their operations from China in recent years and to other countries, like Vietnam, may also view the PGII investments in a positive light, as it would provide a more favourable business climate and investor outlook. CHINA PIVOT TO DIGITAL AND HEALTH SILK ROAD China's efforts to build and link up road, rail and maritime port connections to facilitate trade in economic corridors are often thought of when it comes to BRI. But lockdowns and border closures in many BRI countries during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a slowdown in infrastructure projects. This accelerated China's pivot from hard to soft infrastructure investment projects, leading to an increase in focus on the Digital Silk Road (DSR), and health diplomacy vis-à-vis the Health Silk Road (HSR). The HSR, interlinked with DSR, has emerged as a vehicle for promoting international development cooperation amid the global pandemic, and is evident in China's involvement in the Middle East and North Africa region through medicine and vaccine diplomacy. 
 


 
 
 The DSR was introduced in 2015 to support the expansion and internationalisation of its technology companies, with investments from the 'development of the digital service sector, such as cross-border e-commerce, smart cities, telemedicine, and internet finance,' to accelerating 'technological progress including computing, big data, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, blockchain and quantum computing.' A key aspect of Beijing's technological cooperation with Southeast Asian countries is in information and telecommunication technologies (ICT). Through the DSR, Beijing has invested in ICT-focused telecommunications and digital infrastructure, as well as fibre optic terrestrial and submarine cable networks in this region.  CAN G7 PARTNERSHIP COUNTER BELT AND ROAD? Both initiatives will face challenges in governance and navigating local regulations in recipient countries. Here, the Chinese approach may work in the BRI's favour. As one of Chinese President Xi Jinping's most ambitious international projects, BRI benefits from the straightforward processes of a strong central government in terms of policies and resources. But in practice, Chinese players have encountered challenges on the ground, and have had to become more sensitive and adaptable to local conditions and more mindful of local politics. The increased capital investments can have enormous consequences on the host countries, including exacerbating competition among power elites on a micro-level. On the flip side, the Western approach to investments which tends towards more formalistic application of a uniform set of rules at the three levels of international or bilateral cooperation, domestic regulation and private transactions could end up a strength, as it lends potential to building a more uniform and common approach to global infrastructure standards financed by PGII. 
 
 Without the same top-down structures as BRI, PGII will need to mobilise both public and private resources across seven countries. This could get messy though it is yet unclear how G7 nations will share the risks and responsibilities and agree on the metrics for measuring success. Equally important to the issue of whether the PGII will be a primarily US-led initiative or a G7 (though US-fronted) affair, is the issue of optics. At a time where American primacy appears to be in decline, the PGII will serve to facilitate the US' soft power projection abroad. HEALTHY COMPETITION? It is too early to tell if PGII can counter BRI as a contrasting model of development. But as PGII pushes to gain ground, BRI will not stand still either. Competition heating up may be very well what is needed to incentivise Beijing to push for more reforms, to strengthen the quality of existing investment projects and to reform institutions and policies in two particular areas - emerging technologies and green financing. Through its China Standards 2035, Beijing has ambitions to set global standards for emerging technologies in areas such as artificial intelligence and advanced communications technology. For Beijing, the BRI has served as a conduit for making its own companies more competitive against American and other rivals internationally, particularly in the area of technology standards. 
 
 Another example is the Green Development Finance (GDF), developed by the Belt and Road Initiative International Green Development Coalition (BRIGC). The GDF's primary goal is to encourage Chinese financiers and infrastructure developers to voluntarily select BRI projects with low environmental risks. The emergence of PGII may very well yield positive dividends for global governance, the outcomes which may not necessarily lead to a further bifurcation of the world in terms of bipolar opposites. Instead, it has the potential to pave the way for more sustainable infrastructural development.

Much focus, of course, has been on how PGII will be an alternative mechanism to China's multitrillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), launched almost 10 years ago as a modern-day Silk Road stretching from East Asia to Europe and Africa. PGII is not exactly new: It is a repackaged version of the Build Back Better World (B3W) initiative the G7 proposed a year ago with the same aim to counter China's growing influence, especially in developing countries. Biden stressed the PGII's tangible and political dimensions when he emphasised that it will not only 'deliver returns for everyone"" but would also allow countries to ""see the concrete benefits of partnering with democracies"". PGII RESPONSE TO EMERGING CHALLENGES LIKE CLIMATE AND ENERGY Why now? At first glance, PGII may look better positioned to respond to emerging challenges of a world that has changed in the near-decade since BRI began. It aims to focus on climate and energy security and the development of soft infrastructure in the digital economy, among other things. Flagship projects include a US$600 million global submarine telecommunications cable connecting Singapore to France through Egypt and the Horn of Africa; a US$40 million investment (and expected to mobilise US$2 billion in further investments) in Southeast Asia's Smart Power Program to accelerate rollout of clean energy technologies; and a US$2 billion solar project in southern Angola.

 The PGII will find a receptive audience in this region, given the ever-growing appetite for infrastructure among Southeast Asian countries. Digital infrastructure is particularly important as a key part of ASEAN's digital masterplan is to technologically transform member states into a digital economy and a digital society by 2025. According to a recent Google-led survey, ASEAN's digital economy is on track to grow to US$1 trillion by 2030, particularly in e-commerce and virtual finance domains. Given Southeast Asia's severe vulnerability to climate change, green infrastructure is another area of interest. ASEAN states signed the 2015 Paris Agreement and its Community Vision 2025 specifically recognised the complementarity between the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and ASEAN's community-building endeavours. South Korean manufacturing giants who have shifted their operations from China in recent years and to other countries, like Vietnam, may also view the PGII investments in a positive light, as it would provide a more favourable business climate and investor outlook. CHINA PIVOT TO DIGITAL AND HEALTH SILK ROAD China's efforts to build and link up road, rail and maritime port connections to facilitate trade in economic corridors are often thought of when it comes to BRI. But lockdowns and border closures in many BRI countries during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a slowdown in infrastructure projects. This accelerated China's pivot from hard to soft infrastructure investment projects, leading to an increase in focus on the Digital Silk Road (DSR), and health diplomacy vis-à-vis the Health Silk Road (HSR). The HSR, interlinked with DSR, has emerged as a vehicle for promoting international development cooperation amid the global pandemic, and is evident in China's involvement in the Middle East and North Africa region through medicine and vaccine diplomacy. 
 


 
 
 The DSR was introduced in 2015 to support the expansion and internationalisation of its technology companies, with investments from the 'development of the digital service sector, such as cross-border e-commerce, smart cities, telemedicine, and internet finance,' to accelerating 'technological progress including computing, big data, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, blockchain and quantum computing.' A key aspect of Beijing's technological cooperation with Southeast Asian countries is in information and telecommunication technologies (ICT). Through the DSR, Beijing has invested in ICT-focused telecommunications and digital infrastructure, as well as fibre optic terrestrial and submarine cable networks in this region.  CAN G7 PARTNERSHIP COUNTER BELT AND ROAD? Both initiatives will face challenges in governance and navigating local regulations in recipient countries. Here, the Chinese approach may work in the BRI's favour. As one of Chinese President Xi Jinping's most ambitious international projects, BRI benefits from the straightforward processes of a strong central government in terms of policies and resources. But in practice, Chinese players have encountered challenges on the ground, and have had to become more sensitive and adaptable to local conditions and more mindful of local politics. The increased capital investments can have enormous consequences on the host countries, including exacerbating competition among power elites on a micro-level. On the flip side, the Western approach to investments which tends towards more formalistic application of a uniform set of rules at the three levels of international or bilateral cooperation, domestic regulation and private transactions could end up a strength, as it lends potential to building a more uniform and common approach to global infrastructure standards financed by PGII. 
 
 Without the same top-down structures as BRI, PGII will need to mobilise both public and private resources across seven countries. This could get messy though it is yet unclear how G7 nations will share the risks and responsibilities and agree on the metrics for measuring success. Equally important to the issue of whether the PGII will be a primarily US-led initiative or a G7 (though US-fronted) affair, is the issue of optics. At a time where American primacy appears to be in decline, the PGII will serve to facilitate the US' soft power projection abroad. HEALTHY COMPETITION? It is too early to tell if PGII can counter BRI as a contrasting model of development. But as PGII pushes to gain ground, BRI will not stand still either. Competition heating up may be very well what is needed to incentivise Beijing to push for more reforms, to strengthen the quality of existing investment projects and to reform institutions and policies in two particular areas - emerging technologies and green financing. Through its China Standards 2035, Beijing has ambitions to set global standards for emerging technologies in areas such as artificial intelligence and advanced communications technology. For Beijing, the BRI has served as a conduit for making its own companies more competitive against American and other rivals internationally, particularly in the area of technology standards.

However, little had been heard of the G7's endeavor since then. In June 2022, the Group of Seven decided to breathe new life into the project.""So far, America has failed to build momentum on its plan to Build Back a Better World,"" says Francesco Sisci, a Beijing-based China expert, author, and columnist. ""However, with this new G7 plan, which includes other countries, this momentum could start to be built. It is a question mark. Nobody is sure until things are realized. But you cannot just underestimate and dismiss this plan, because there is a large commitment of many countries with a large economy and this plan could make big sense.""The G7's grand design envisages laying a secure sub-sea telecommunications cable that will connect Singapore to France through Egypt and the Horn of Africa; creating a COVID-19 vaccine plant in Senegal; expanding solar projects in Angola, including solar mini-grids and home power grids; and establishing an innovative modular nuclear reactor plant in Romania, among other issues.The US president pledged to mobilize $200 billion in investments in global infrastructure projects over the next five years. The overall investment, including G7 member states and private capital, is expected to reach $600 billion.Sisci suggests that the club of developed capitalist countries ""may end up being more effective in many ways [than China], a smaller non-capitalist country.""""China, but also Russia, by far, don't have the size, the gravitas to oppose even a divided G7, which is coming together because of this opposition to China or Russia-driven projects,"" he notes.G7 Economic & Geopolitical HurdlesHowever, some other observers express skepticism over the ability of the US and G7 to implement the project given record-high inflation and cost of living crisis currently engulfing the states. The US, British and European central banks are struggling to tame skyrocketing inflation by raising interest rates to reduce demand, which is prompting recession fears.He notes that previously the US Senate voted Biden's landmark Build Back Better initiative down, and for good reason, as Republican congressmen feared that the Democratic administration's spending spree would fan inflation and increase an already bloated national debt.Pauken also expresses bewilderment over the G7's apparent readiness to embark on the bold international project at a time when the group is involved in the Ukraine crisis with the UK trying to keep the military conflict dragging on. ""I mean, it's laughable that they have to think about [competing with] China at this time when they're on the brink of a major war in Europe,"" the commentator remarks.Meanwhile, the G7's Global Investment and Infrastructure Partnership cannot be regarded so far as a viable alternative to the Beijing-led Belt and Road Initiative that has been implemented for slightly less than a decade, according to Pauken.In particular, China invested almost $59.5 billion in its comprehensive infrastructure project in 2021 alone. When it comes to crucial elements of the project, the West appears to be lagging behind. While the G7 is still considering building a subsea cable linking Europe and Southeast Asia, China kicked off its Digital Silk Road (DSR) almost seven years ago. The DSR's backbone is the Pakistan and East Africa Connecting Europe (PEACE), a 9,300 mile long subsea cable network meant to tie Asia, Africa, and Europe together. The network is designed to transmit over 16Tbps per fibre pair with its Mediterranean section going from Egypt to France having already been laid.Are Emerging Economies Interested in the G7 Agenda?There is yet another problem as to how to make these Western projects attractive for Global South nations, the Asia Pacific expert continues. In particular, the G7 has been pushing ahead with a climate change agenda and the plan to cut carbon emissions, which is not relevant for the majority of third-world states which are still reliant on cheaper and more reliable fossil fuels and coal plants, he notes.Many emerging economies, including African countries, are beginning to have a growing frustration with the US and Europe, according to Pauken. The reality is that Africans and many of the emerging markets want to focus on economic stuff, he notes. However, when the US officials come in, they're talking about climate change or gender equity, and this is not as interesting to developing nations, the commentator emphasizes.""[Developing nations] want help on improving their agricultural production levels and boosting their energy capacity, which the Russians and the Chinese have been doing,"" Pauken notes.Given all of the above, it is unlikely that the G7's Global Investment and Infrastructure Partnership initiative is going to actually happen, argues the geopolitical commentator.https://sputniknews.com/20220619/uks-looming-recession-is-self-inflicted-bojo-and-boe-are-to-blame-economists-say-1096450258.htmlhttps://sputniknews.com/20210416/challenge-or-opportunity-how-chinas-digital-silk-road-may-change-global-technology-order-1082641074.htmlhttps://sputniknews.com/20220620/wfp-announces-cuts-in-food-rations-for-refugees-in-east-west-africa-due-to-lack-of-funds-1096498394.htmlchinaSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com+74956456601MIA 'Rosiya Segodnya' 2022Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com+74956456601MIA 'Rosiya Segodnya' https://cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com/img/105338/47/1053384758_130:0:4574:3333_1920x0_80_0_0_b06a9ade3ea9a64df5eb53b92651bd3f.jpgSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com+74956456601MIA 'Rosiya Segodnya' us, europe, asia & pacific, china, g7, belt and road initiative, build back better, climate change, infrastructure, inflation, recessionThe Build Back Better World (B3W) program was pompously announced by the club of seven developed nations to counter China's Belt and Road at the G7 Summit in Cornwall in July 2021.

It provides vast opportunities and geographic reach to both established businesses and new enterprises. On a macro level, ecommerce is reshaping global trade. The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of ecommerce and digital transformation. Consumers have resorted to ecommerce to meet their shopping needs. As a result, ecommerce has become an important factor in domestic markets – supply and distribution of goods and services increasingly revolve around ecommerce. This is seen particularly in the rise of the gig economy – ehailing and delivery services have benefited greatly despite business closures and rising unemployment. Businesses that adopted ecommerce are also better equipped to mitigate the impact of lockdown. Ecommerce has brought new opportunities, but also brought to light the importance of addressing existing barriers. As international trade has promoted economic growth and exchanges between countries in the past, today ecommerce also provides opportunities for greater cooperation and economic growth between China and Malaysia. Ecommerce in Malaysia The Malaysian government has attempted to facilitate digitalisation with the myDigital initiative and Malaysia Digital Economy Blueprint. The government sees digital economy as an important contributor to the nation economy, and it has focused on accelerating the country's progress through digitalisation, while ensuring that no Malaysian gets left behind. In the private sector, ecommerce platforms like Lazada, Grab and Shopee enabled small businesses, and even micro-businesses, to open with minimal start-up costs and compete in global markets. Even though ecommerce in Malaysia is relatively robust, room for improvement remains. Challenges exist in adoption of new digital tools, cybersecurity threats, digital marketing skills, restricted production capacity, high logistic cost, and absence of knowledge regarding market access and rules in cross-border ecommerce. Other barriers include broadband services, overreliance on cash, lack of consumers' trust, poor digital skills among the population, and lack of government support. International standards can play in enhancing national digital resilience and building trust in ecommerce. In this, concrete initiatives are needed, such as ecommerce willingness assessments and strategy formulation, information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure and services, access to financing for ecommerce, ecommerce skills development, and empowering entrepreneurs in developing countries. What China has done in ecommerce, and how Malaysia can learn from it. Leading Internet corporations are growing their ecommerce arm and mobile payment services, especially in and South and Southeast Asia. Alibaba has been setting up logistic centres in key markets, including Malaysia. Merger and acquisition activity also increasingly emphasise collaboration with local companies to speedup incorporation. This has been reinforced by a rise in ecommerce free trade areas. Cross-border ecommerce is a significant part of China's Internet Plus strategy. It reflects online sales as an effective way of boosting consumption, as well as its growing contribution in regional value chains, especially among SMEs and in the agricultural sector. This is further aided by fintech projects by AliPay and WeChat Pay, China's foremost epayment service providers. Alibaba's subsidiary Ant Financial has followed a similar strategy, obtaining shares of fintech companies, such as in the Philippines (Mynt), Malaysia (Touch ‘n Go), and India (PayTM). Malaysia was the first country to host an eWTP (Electronic World Trade Platform) hub outside of China. Ecommerce entrees require guidance on setting up online stores and digital marketing strategies. Incubator programs play an important role to help grow these aspiring entrepreneurs. Malaysia can learn from China's ecommerce development by keeping pace with the latest trend and innovations, engaging experts to further improve the local ecommerce ecosystem and apply big data to understand consumer demand. There is also room for Malaysia to benefit from China's untapped internet market potential, as 45% of the Chinese population still lack internet access. How the BRI helps ecommerce The ecommerce push in the BRI-participating economies saw Alibaba and JD.com providing a platform for less-developed economies to access consumer goods from supermarket chains and shopping malls. The Digital Silk Road (DSR) has progressed into improving recipient countries' telecommunications networks and digital technologies, including AI capabilities, cloud computing, ecommerce, and other digital economic areas. Projects in telecommunications, ecommerce and other forms of innovative technology applied to smart cities have benefited as a result. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, in May, promised to accelerate the construction of new infrastructure such as 5G networks and data centres. Haitong Securities predicts new infrastructure investments will total RMB17.5 trillion (or US$2.47 trillion) in the next five years, or roughly RMB3.0 trillion on average yearly. The new infrastructure investment will have spillover benefits for governments and firms along the Belt and Road, which often receive low-interest soft loans from state banks to purchase Chinese tech products. China and economies cooperating with it under the BRI are an increasingly significant part of the world economy. The digital BRI could boost China's export of digital surveillance technologies to countries as part of the war against Covid-19, especially in implementing contact tracing. While 5G rollout and China's surveillance equipment sales tend to dominate headlines, the significance of information and communications technology to economic growth and development should not be overlooked. Investments in digital infrastructure could aid economic recovery by increasing demand and generating employment, and in the long run, drive economic transformation by enhancing output and trade in goods and services.

The number of Chinese nationals in secretariat and leadership positions in critical multi-stakeholder SSOs such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) has also surged in the past decade.Beyond the IEC, ISO, and ITU, Chinese actors are also active in other SSOs including the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) that develops 5G technical specifications, as well as Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the report said, adding that the companies such as Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei, Tencent and ZTE are advanced members of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standards Association.Not only do Chinese firms 'flood' committees with a huge volume of standards proposals, but they also typically vote as a single bloc. Beijing also has a tendency to use its debt and trade leverage to influence the votes of a number of countries in favour of its proposals. This produces a strikingly high rate of success in the number of Chinese submissions at the ITU, the report said.Another emerging facet of China's approach to technology standards-setting is the Digital Silk Road (DSR) which is one of the primary vehicles delivering Chinese technology to BRI partner states.

31;Double Standards? China's influence in international standards.;https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/author/sergio-restelli/;2022-04-08 15:30:00;timezone unknown;https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/double-standards-chinas-influence-in-international-standards/;timesofisrael.com;From the blog of Sergio Restelli at The Times of Israel;"One of the uncontested beneficiaries of Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine is China. Beijing's geopolitical moves continue to disguise its larger designs. It is now widely known that Xi Jinping's assertive foreign policy's goal is to make China a ‘major power with pioneering global influence' by 2049, the centenary of the founding of People's Republic of China. To this end, China has been leveraging its technological prowess and geopolitical heft to shape the global technological environment and standards setting for future technologies to serve its commercial and strategic interests. 
China's has adopted a state-directed strategy to influence international standards setting, and use them as a foreign policy tool to enhance its global standing. The Xi administration has employed a dual-track approach to setting international technology standards. On the one hand, it seeks to influence both the multilateral (governmental) and the multi-stakeholder technical Standards Setting Organisations (SSOs) by placing Chinese nationals in senior leadership positions and larger representation of Chinese tech companies, and on the other hand, Chinese companies, with guidance from the Party-State, are creating standards utilizing the BRI and Digital Silk Road (DSR). 
At the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), China is second only to the US by the number of entities registered as ITU members. The involvement of Chinese commercial entities at the ITU has increased thanks to the impetus provided by ITU's current Secretary-General, Zhao Houlin who has served two terms as Director of ITU's Telecommunication Standardization Bureau (STB). In 2021 alone, Chinese entities backed 145 new standards at the ITU, up from 46 in 2015 and six times more than Western entities.  The number of Chinese nationals in secretariat and leadership positions in critical multi-stakeholder SSOs such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) has surged in the past decade. Chinese Yinbiao Shu who heads the IEC, an industry association that publishes international standards for electrical, electronic and related technologies, is also the Chairman of the China Huaneng Group. At the ISO, Zhang Xiaogang from China served as ISO President between 2015 and 2018. 
Beyond the IEC, ISO, and ITU, Chinese actors are also active in other SSOs. For example, China has the largest number of individual members within 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), that develops 5G technical specifications. At the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Chinese actors are very active in submitting documents (surpassed only by US representatives). Companies such as Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei, Tencent and ZTE are advanced members of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standards Association.
Not only do Chinese firms ‘flood' committees with a huge volume of standards proposals, they also typically vote as a single bloc. Beijing also has a tendency to use its debt and trade leverage to influence votes of a number of countries in favor of its proposals. This produces a strikingly high rate of success in the number of Chinese submissions at the ITU. 
Many times, proposals put forward by Chinese entities attack existing concepts and promote the Chinese prerogative. For example, in 2020, Huawei, along with China Unicom, China Telecom and the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), proposed a new standard for core network technology, called ‘New IP' contending that the existing internet infrastructure was unstable and vastly insufficient to meet the requirements of the digital world. 
Another emerging facet of China's approach to technology standards setting is the Digital Silk Road (DSR) that is one of the primary vehicles delivering Chinese technology to BRI partner states. By signing agreements with BRI partner governments, Beijing is propagating its own technology standards in project host states, creating dependencies that lock these countries into using Chinese vendors and standards. 
In light of above, it is apparent that Beijing's moves are aimed at setting global standards for the next-generation technologies. It wants to gain control over key technologies like Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Big Data, 5G and artificial intelligence. International organizations need to wary about these manoeuvers in order to prevent Beijing from dominating global technology standards and thus gaining monopoly over world's future-shaping technologies.";timesofisrael.com;1087;news;IL;en;https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/author/sergio-restelli/;https://static.timesofisrael.com/blogs/uploads/2021/10/eu-china.jpeg;False;timesofisrael;29.320667;46a8d6b77565963c8c7087d303e7d51d;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND DSR', 'lang': 'en', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'from': '3 years ago', 'sort_by': 'date', 'page': 1}

33;Will China Become the First Cyber Superpower?;;2022-03-20 19:00:00;full;https://nationalinterest.org/blog/techland-when-great-power-competition-meets-digital-world/will-china-become-first-cyber;nationalinterest.org;China's influence over global technologies through its efforts in global governance and its technological trade with the developing world could cement a new position for China as the cyber superpower…;"Most states desire some influence over the cyber domain. China is no different. Nearly a decade ago, China clearly articulated its aims to be a 'cyber superpower,' a status that suggests at least some willingness to vie for power with the United States. This ambition suggests that, at the time, China planned to transform from being a 'major cyber country' into a 'cyber superpower.'
China has been transparent about its cyber grand strategy and the centrality of that strategy to its overall plan for maintaining a stable Chinese state. In 2017, a research institute of China's chief cyber legislative body, the Cyberspace Administration of China, soberly declared in a leading Chinese Communist Party (CCP) journal, 'if our party cannot traverse the hurdle represented by the Internet, it cannot traverse the hurdle of remaining in power for the long term.' In 2018, President Xi Jinping stressed that without cybersecurity there is no national security. With the U.S. director of national intelligence describing China as a 'near peer competitor' just last year and some indices placing China just behind the United States in terms of cyber power, China's rise in influence in the cyber domain is undeniable. China's ambitions to become a cyber superpower have seemingly been realized.
The concept 'cyber superpower' is multifaceted, incorporating not only the destructive cyber-attacks that grab headlines across the world, but also a state's cyber defenses, influence over the information domain, surveillance, espionage, influence over global cyber norms and technical standards, and commercial technological competence. The United States remains in the lead across many of these aspects of cyber power, but China's influence over global technologies through its efforts in global governance and its technological trade with the developing world could cement a new position for China as the cyber superpower in the long term.
China's desire to affect global governance, particularly in the cyber domain, was articulated in 2015 at the China-hosted 'World Internet Conference' in Wuzhen. Xi called on countries to respect each other's cyber sovereignty, a phrase which implies a government's right to choose how to develop and regulate the internet within its borders. China's technological efforts to control its domestic cyber domain are well understood and far reaching. Measures include the Great Firewall, which blocks foreign services such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, to content removals of posts that criticize CCP policy. Freedom on the Net's reports on the state of conditions for internet users in China outline its profound oppressiveness. The Chinese government's measures and ultimate goal are, of course, in many ways in direct opposition to the United States' vision of open, free, and bottom-up governance of the internet.
Internationally, China has invested significantly in another component of cyber power—shaping the global digital ecosystem to its vision. One way to enforce rules in digital ecosystems is through influencing international technical standards—specifications by which products, services, and processes are standardized so that they are interoperable across borders. The U.S. government's approach to influencing technical standards, in contrast to China, is more hands-off, preferring industry to lead the standardization efforts. Influencing the international standardization system does not appear to have been a strategic priority for the U.S. government, which is what has perhaps paved the way, over the past decade, for Chinese candidates to stand at the helm of several leading international standards development organizations (SDOs), from the International Organization of Standardization to the International Electrotechnical Commission and the International Telecommunications Union. The divergence in approach between the Chinese government and other governments is most problematic in the International Telecommunications Union telecommunications standardization sector (ITU-T), a multilateral standards development organization, where the power lies in national governments with one state, one vote. The absence of U.S. leadership in this forum and increasing Chinese dominance in the ITU-T was notable and came to a head when China proposed 'New-IP'—a replacement protocol for the current foundation of the global internet. There was significant opposition to China's efforts to reshape the foundation of the internet by the Internet Society, the parent organization of the SDO responsible for standardizing the current internet protocols, as well as a coalition of Western governments. New-IP in its original proposed form has now been put to bed, and in 2021 there was a flurry of activity by the United States and its allies to collectively champion the industry-led, consensus-based, multistakeholder approaches to international standards development in opposition to China's influence in SDOs. These efforts can be observed and followed through announcements made by the Quad, the G7, and the EU-U.S. Trade & Technology Council.
However, these coalitions will not be enough. Influencing international technical standards is important, but what really matters is adoption in the market. This is where China's Digital Silk Road (DSR), a sub-component of the 2015 Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), will help China realize its ambitions to become the cyber superpower. In 2016, Chinese media reported that China had concluded memorandums of understanding with sixteen countries on DSR construction. Through the DSR, Chinese tech companies are supported to gain footholds in politically unstable markets where other companies might not venture due to limited short-term commercial upside. This support from the Chinese government thereby lays the foundation for a technological path dependency on developing markets for Chinese technology which could result in many years of trade and services to maintain and upgrade these digital ecosystems.
Influencing both the international technical standards from the top and having the industry to adopt and proliferate these standards on the ground are needed to shape digital ecosystems. The relative absence of non-Chinese tech companies in developing markets is a weakness for the United States and its allies. And while the United States and its allies individually may not have the same types of technology companies on their own, together they might. While it is more difficult for American and European governments to plan long-term strategies to stay ahead technologically, it is imperative they do so with regard to China or else they may inadvertently leave the door wide open for China to become not only a but the cyber superpower.

In late June 2018, the Nigerian government announced that Chinese companies have invested a staggering $16 billion in Nigeria's telecommunication industry.
By September same year, the government also agreed to a $328 million loan from Chinese state bank Exim to upgrade Nigeria's telecoms infrastructure.
The agreement was signed between China's EXIM Bank and the Galaxy Backbone (a telecommunications company in Nigeria, with Huawei working on the project.
President Muhammadu Buhari's administration said the loan represents 'the current administration's commitment to incorporating the development of information and communications technology into national strategic planning'. This is a demonstration of China's direct interest in the tech ecosystem of Nigeria.
Chinese companies and Nigeria
Nigeria is said to be the largest African economy and one of the fastest-growing markets on the continent. From the 1990s 'Going Out' period, Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE have rapidly grown their presence on the African continent, with experts linking the growth to the cheaper products and services offered by the companies.
However, observers noted that China's penetration into Africa should be seen within the context of its Digital Silk Road (DSR) programme, which it launched in 2015. The DSR was said to be introduced in 2015 by an official Chinese government white paper, as a component of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
The programme delivers digital infrastructure, including fibreoptic cables, data centres and indeed next-generation cellular networks, to partner countries. A report in 2018 disclosed that DSR-related investments in digital infrastructure projects outside of China had reached $79 billion.
Interestingly, Nigeria, Zambia, Angola, Ethiopia and Zimbabwe have benefited from the project, with an estimated investment value totalling $8.43bn. According to a 2018 study conducted by the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa, after African governments, China was the continent's second-largest source of infrastructure financing, committing $25.7bn to African countries that year.
Also, about 50 percent of Africa's 3G networks and 70 percent of its 4G networks are built by Huawei, the world's leading seller of 5G technology and smartphones, a 2021 April Report by the Atlantic Council's Africa Center disclosed. According to projections, Nigeria, together with China, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan, will contribute half of the 1.6 billion mobile internet users by 2025.
ICT expert, Ahmad Galadima said Nigeria is very attractive to investors as Africa's most populous country.
According to him, the success of MTN, Airtel and 9mobile has shown that Nigeria is the biggest market in terms of telecom in Africa. 'The huge internet penetration of Nigeria creates a huge potential for businesses.' he stated.
Since launching business operations in Nigeria in 1999, Huawei has invested about US$76 million within the country. The company has also been selected by the Nigerian government as a core partner in building smart cities and e-government applications to 'reshape the way public services are provided and managed' within the country.
'China has developed its technology economy as well as industry. It is looking for other markets outside the country. China invests heavily in many so areas. For China to invest such hugely in Nigeria, it doesn't mean it does not know what it does, it is a great opportunity,' the Director, Institute of Legislative Studies, University of Abuja, Prof. Sheriff Ghali Ibrahim said.
Ibrahim observed that China's Investment in Nigeria was a result of the country being the largest technology in Africa and having an information telecommunication infrastructure deficit.
In addition, Huawei, through its acclaimed Seeds for the Future global Corporate Social Responsibility program, trained more than 600 students in 14 sub-Saharan countries covering emerging ICT technologies such as 5G, cloud computing, and AI.
The programme which was launched in 2008 was aimed to help nurture local talent, promote knowledge transfer, increase people's understanding and interest in the ICT industry, and encourage countries and regions to participate in digital community building.
In 2017, about ten Nigerian students were sponsored to China by Huawei to major in ICT-related studies and practical ICT insights.
The students were said to be selected from those who signed to the Huawei Authorised Information and Network Academy (HAINA) or Huawei ICT Academy, including students from the University of Lagos, the University of Benin and the University of Nsukka, Nigeria.
'The programme seeks to develop local ICT talent, enhance knowledge transfer, promote a greater understanding of, and interest in the ICT sector, and to improve and encourage regional building and participation in the digital economy,' Channel Service Director of Huawei Technologies Company Nigeria Limited, Mr Simon Zhang said.
Generally, by 2021, the program has been implemented in 131 countries and territories worldwide, with nearly 9,000 students participating. Since 2014, the program has been held in sub-Saharan African countries. So far, 25 countries in Africa, including Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Ghana, have participated in the training, which has so far benefitted more than 1,000 students.
However, experts argued that although Chinese companies' involvement in Nigeria appears to have benefited the companies, the Chinese government also appears to have benefited from this involvement.
For instance, given that companies like Huawei's corporate structure subject it to international market pressure which may serve as a barrier to limit the extent of Chinese government influence, however, whether intentional or otherwise, there are nonetheless numerous examples on how the Chinese state has benefited from Huawei's extensive involvement in Nigeria.
But at the heart of the investments, are concerns that Chinese companies could leverage upon surveillance mechanisms through the use of big data and thus create additional security externalities for the Chinese government. Implications of China's massive investments in Nigeria's telecom sector
The U.S government and some of its European allies have long raised concerns about how China companies, especially Huawei and its equipment could be used by Chinese authorities to spy on the countries that install it. This is an allegation Huawei has repeatedly denied.
Although the suspicion might have arisen due to the trade war between US and China, observers believe the rivalry risks dividing the world with a digital iron curtain. For instance, U.S allies including New Zealand and Australia had banned Huawei and ZTE from providing equipment for 5G wireless technology citing national security, Canada had one time arrested Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on allegations she defrauded banks to violate Iranian sanctions.
Taiwan had also alerted that China's Beidou Satellite System constitutes an information security risk to the country.
It alleged that the satellite is able to ‘track smartphone users via embedded malware in devices with Chinese-manufactured chips directly tied into the system or phones manufactured in China.'
The ministry further reported that China's satellite system, 'despite claims of being commercial in nature, was primarily for military use, adding that over the past few years, many smartphone vehicle navigation products using Beidou Satellite System guidance chips have been imported to Taiwan.'
But it seems the US and Europe's concerns that Huawei's equipment can be used for espionage on their governments and citizens do not seem as pressing a concern for Nigeria.
However, this is likely to have implications, especially in the realm of digital surveillance. Experts have argued that the spread of data centres run by Chinese companies in Nigeria could indeed leverage surveillance mechanisms through the use of big data and thus create additional security externalities for the Chinese state.
According to them, Data centres serve as platforms from which governments collect data to monitor individuals in real-time.
Meanwhile, there are insinuations that Chinese commercial actors involved in Huawei's construction of digital infrastructure in Nigeria already share data with the Chinese government. The African Union had on-time alleged that over a period of five years, data was being transferred on a daily basis from its Huawei and ZTE- supplied computer systems to servers located in Shanghai.
Another notable implication is in the area of control of internet access. According to China Internet Security Law, within China, it is compulsory for Chinese firms to assist the Chinese government in identifying Internet users with their real identities. This is part of a wider objective of 'national defence, social peace and the protection of infrastructure.'
Observers noted that Chinese censorship practices, such as keyword filters, can even be easily propagated and implemented through cooperation between foreign governments and Chinese technology companies abroad.
Indeed, the Nigerian government alleged interest in the import of the 'Great Firewall' is an example in this regard.
In June 2021, the Nigerian government banned Twitter after the tech company removed a tweet from Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari's account.
It was subsequently alleged that the Nigerian government officials had met representatives from the Cyberspace Administration of China to discuss how China's 'Great Firewall' could be implemented in Nigeria. Observers said Nigeria towing this part is echoing a worrisome trend in Africa Should Nigeria be worried?
When contacted, Boye Adegoke of Paradigm Initiative Nigeria (PIN) said the Nigerian government and citizens should be worried about China's massive investment in Nigeria's telecommunication sector.
According to him, looking at China's disposition to the internet, China is not a supporter of an open internet.
'China pushes for a closed internet which is what they are practising in their own country. There is nobody that is bringing something into a country without an underlying self-interest. Looking at what is happening in the global political space, that struggle for hegemony is being reloaded by China.
'Over the years China has maintained that world leadership thing. With respect to the internet, the US was the pioneer and has occupied that hegemonic space over the years and China has been challenging that significantly and trying to compete with the US. Apart from that China has been trying to market its own model of the internet.
'So when such investments are made there are a lot of interests involved. These interests might be business, political or regional political interest, in terms of trying to dominate a particular people.'
On if such investment was a form of recolonisation, Adegoke, who is the manager of Digital Rights Initiative and Intervention projects in affirmation said there is a scramble for the Nigeria market by developed countries.
According to him, what Nigerians should be interested in is the component of such investments.
'Are we just collecting the money? Who is doing the due diligence to ensure that we are not spending the future of Nigeria and that we are not giving so much away? I think that is where our problems.
'We should be worried especially looking at China's disposition to the internet. China is not a supporter of an open internet. China pushes for a closed internet which is what they are practising in their own country.
'They try to create a firewall whereby the system is muted from the rest of the world, especially the western world.
He added that the problem of having such kind of investment is that Nigerians are not even sure that they are not conniving with the Nigerian government 'because we know our government wants a controlled internet space'.
'The people, therefore, are at the receiving end of this because it will limit our experience. One thing Nigerians are benefitting is that we can explore the internet and have no limitations to where we can get opportunities from because there is access to all of the internet, not some part. Young people should be worried about this.
He said another thing Nigerians should be concerned about is the incompetence on the part of our government.
'That is if it is not the Nigerian government actually conniving with these people, could they potentially be signing things they don't really understand without doing proper diligence?
'ICT is a broad place. The government may be making business decisions whereas those decisions have a surveillance dimension. That is where the problem lies. Are the decision-makers just been greedy by the opportunity to seal a deal or sign another contract or for political consideration – just to say that they have achieved something, without knowing what is therein,' he queried?
Nigeria can take China to court for any breach noticed
ICT expert, Galadima said Cyber security is something everybody should be worried about. He however noted that Nigeria can approach the court if there is any breach in its ICT networks relating to its agreement with China.

In this competition, the United States and China are the front-runners, with both countries surging forward based on their respective competitive advantages: the U.S. has cutting-edge hardware, research, and talent, while China has a massive trove of the AI-ready data that fuels technological development, and a strong political will to succeed.The dominance of these two countries in the tech sector undoubtedly has strategic implications for Southeast Asia, which predominantly relies on importing and using AI technology from the U.S. and China. What are the implications of choosing the technology of one country over the other? Will Southeast Asian countries face problems related to digital colonization and national sovereignty?Some scholars have described Southeast Asia as a testing ground and a gateway for China's expansion as a superpower. Indeed, China is increasingly regarded by Southeast Asians as the most influential economic power in the region and, to a lesser extent, the most influential politically and strategically.China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a trillion-dollar international infrastructure program spanning nearly 140 countries, is part of its plan to increase its global influence. An important part of the BRI is its reach into the digital space through the Digital Silk Road (DSR). The DSR's key components – 5G technologies, massive data centers, investments in AI, and satellite navigation systems – have major implications for data privacy, national security, and the global governance of cyberspace. Observers have expressed concerns about cyber espionage and cybersecurity, as these technological advances would give the Chinese government the ability to access, analyze, and exploit in real-time the large data sets of BRI recipient countries. Additionally, think tanks and scholars have warned of China 'exporting authoritarianism,' 'exporting political illiberalism,' or pushing 'authoritarian capitalism' globally through the distribution of Chinese technologies.NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
Discussions about the geopolitical risks of China achieving global dominance in AI paint the power struggle between the U.S. and China as a showdown between liberal democracy and digital authoritarianism. However, while the U.S. is often considered as a more benign force, worries about the Chinese state's overreach apply and overlap significantly in the case of the U.S.Enjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.The 2013 revelations of Edward Snowden, a former contractor to the U.S. intelligence agencies, laid bare the impressive breadth and depth of Washington's global surveillance capabilities and cyber espionage practices. A particularly powerful example is the PRISM program, which enables the routine mass collection of data from major big tech companies. But while these revelations shook the world, privacy concerns regarding AI-enabled automated mass surveillance remain unaddressed.In the discourse on the geopolitics of AI, some scholars have taken the theoretical lens of digital or data colonization to analyze the position of the Global South, listing the ways in which algorithms can be used to oppress, exploit, and dispossess vulnerable populations.However, experts and academics in the AI field interviewed for EngageMedia's recent study on AI governance in Southeast Asia pointed out that focusing on national sovereignty distracts us from seeing the matter holistically, as a complex interplay of state and market forces working together and against each other.AdvertisementWhile the respondents acknowledged that data predominantly flows toward China and the U.S., and that Southeast Asia's dependency on technologies coming from the two AI superpowers may disadvantage the nations of the region, some experts said that the exploitation of data would occur with or without the involvement of foreign companies. They noted that since Southeast Asia's data protection regulations are either weak or non-existent, similar harms from misusing data collection would arise in any event with local players.It is therefore more important to focus on creating a strong regulatory and policy foundation locally, so that data protection and technology usage do not merely rely on the ethics or goodwill of the owners of the technologies, whether they be American, Chinese, or from another nation.It is also important to recognize that Southeast Asian countries have the agency to choose the technologies that they use and to negotiate for favorable terms. Some respondents in the study alluded to this when asked about the implications of the U.S.-China tech rivalry; their position was that Southeast Asian states would decide what is best for their countries, whether in terms of price and functionality, or from a strategic point of view.For example, a case study on Alibaba's activities in Malaysia (which includes a Digital Free Trade Zone and Alibaba's City Brain smart cities program) argues that Malaysia derives real economic and infrastructural benefits from working with Alibaba, geopolitical and privacy concerns notwithstanding. The study concluded that other countries 'desperately need to improve the quality of their game in Southeast Asia,' and that 'railing against Chinese government-dominated initiatives and the DSR is not an adequate strategy.'A study from Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute on 5G adoption in the region shows that countries in Southeast Asia display different levels of trust toward China, with Laos and Cambodia having the highest preference for Chinese providers, versus the Philippines, Vietnam, and Singapore with the lowest. While trust toward China was higher in 2019, telecommunications providers in the region appear to have diversified their vendor selection in 2020, following U.S. restrictions on Chinese technologies. At the moment, Nokia (Finland) and Ericsson (Sweden), alongside Huawei and ZTE (both China) are the biggest players in the 5G landscape in Southeast Asia, with U.S. companies (Altiostar, Cisco, and Qualcomm) having no significant presence.In the short term, the rivalry between the U.S. and China in the region may offer Southeast Asian countries the leverage to negotiate better terms than they would get otherwise and provide more choices to balance their own interests. However, in the longer term, the bifurcation of Chinese and American technologies, standards, and norms will lead to a decline in multilateralism. This can create disadvantages for weaker countries, as they may not have the negotiating power or enforcement capabilities of a bloc. Additionally, international efforts at developing common norms, trickling down to local laws, may be derailed.Southeast Asian nations must find ways to identify and address some of the inherent weaknesses and challenges that undermine their capacity to plan for and support the adoption of AI technologies. This will enable them to reap the benefits of AI on their own terms and find their place in a future AI ecosystem dominated by the two superpowers.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2022-02-07-044540.jpg;False;;27.394989;9fdb1b3eaaa6320c4be66b49145970d5;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND DSR', 'lang': 'en', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'from': '3 years ago', 'sort_by': 'date', 'page': 1}

It is essentially the technology dimension of the BRI and encompasses all things technology related, from 'the development of the digital service sector, such as cross-border e-commerce, smart cities, telemedicine, and internet finance,' to accelerating 'technological progress including computing, big data, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, block chain, and quantum computing.'
Hitherto driven mainly by Chinese private companies and seen largely as a branding tool for Beijing to promote its global vision of technology, the DSR is increasingly becoming a central part of the BRI, and the Chinese government is increasingly taking a strategic approach to it. At the first BRI forum in Beijing in May 2017, Chinese leader Xi Jinping emphasized the role of the DSR within BRI, calling for international cooperation in the areas of digital economy and the integration of new technologies such as AI, cloud computing, smart cities, quantum computing, big data, and nanotechnology into the BRI to foster innovation-driven development. With the DSR, Beijing aims to facilitate Chinese companies' participation in the development of information and communication technologies globally, to increase China's capacity and influence in setting global technology standards and cyber governance norms, to enable Beijing to influence global discourse on China, and to accelerate China's ascent to global technology leadership.

China, Asia

Why is China's market share and quality so low? Its rivals have most of the";"Why is China's market share and quality so low? Its rivals have most of the latest technology. China does not.

One of China's top initiatives to promote innovation in the digital sector is the international Digital Silk Road (DSR), a component of the Belt and Road Initiative. Through the DSR, China will expand into foreign markets, secure access to foreign suppliers and consumers, and establish technological standards in information and communications technology. If successful, the DSR will provide demand for the steady economic innovation that China needs. Yet the DSR and its promise of innovation is contingent on China's success in hardware. Although the country is facing competition abroad, the most formidable obstacles to Chinese economic innovation are domestic. China became a leader in 5G technology, but its level of innovation lags in a different sector. China's primary innovation challenge is its lack of indigenous capabilities in high-value digital hardware, particularly semiconductor logic chips.

From 2010-2020, China attempted to consolidate the semiconductor industry, encourage domestic semiconductor companies to share research and development, have foreigners reduce export controls, and gain human capital with high skills from foreign countries. In early 2022, however, China still does not design or fabricate a substantial number of the highest-value semiconductor logic chips (Chinese market share is less than 1 percent and Chinese share of the global market is less than 6 percent). But this is only part of the problem. The two highest value semiconductor logic chips are central processing units (CPU) and graphics processing units (GPU). As George Calhoun noted, in both categories, Chinese-produced chips are not only lower-quality but uncompetitive, even in China. Why is China chronically behind in semiconductor logic design, fabs, and foundries? Does the country simply require more time, or is a different set of strategies needed? To answer these questions, an assessment of China's primary challenges in semiconductor design and production is needed.

The most immediate issues China faces in its semiconductor industry are competitiveness and quality. Although China has some of the required technical capabilities, it does not have all or enough of them. Consider Zhaoxin, a Chinese semiconductor company. It is the only Chinese company to produce x86 CPUs (arguably the top-performing CPU), and it supplies its own semiconductor design to electronics companies Lenovo and Hewlett-Packard. Huawei and Tsinghua Unigroup each have their own subsidiary producing semiconductor logic chips, but they license core intellectual property from a British company. 'Despite being one of the world's top five semiconductor foundries in the world,' wrote Zen Soo and Meng Jing, China's 'SMIC [Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation] only began to produce 14nm semiconductors this year. That makes it three generations – or at least six years – behind its rivals.'

Generally speaking, China designs memory chips, which are easier to produce than logic chips, and is a leader in semiconductor assembly and packaging. Thus, while China is making progress in the design of semiconductor logic chips, it still largely produces lower-quality semiconductors. The government's 'Made in China 2025' strategy intends to supply 70 percent of China's semiconductor demand through indigenous design and production, but it is unclear if that goal will be achieved by the plan's deadline. In their current state, Chinese semiconductor companies cannot meet Chinese demand for semiconductors, much less global demand. This means that Chinese manufacturers will remain heavily reliant on high-quality semiconductors produced overseas.

According to a January 2021 report from Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology on the semiconductor supply chain, the

U.S. semiconductor industry contributes 39 percent of the total value of the global semiconductor supply chain. U.S.-allied nations and regions—Japan, Europe (especially the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Germany), Taiwan, and South Korea—collectively contribute another 53 percent. Together, these countries and regions enjoy a competitive advantage in virtually every supply chain segment.

Why are China's market share and quality so low? Its rivals have most of the latest technology. China does not.

Having declared high-end semiconductors a strategic industry in the early 2000s, the Chinese government now understands that developing capabilities in this sector is a decades-long process. But in education, where the long-term battle is won, China is behind. According to Hongbin Li, et al.'s article 'Human Capital and China's Future Growth' in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, in the United States, 90 percent of the labor force is composed of high school graduates; college graduates make up 45 percent (as of 2015). In China, college graduates and high school graduates made up 12.5 percent and 28.8 percent, respectively, of the workforce. China's high school and college graduate numbers were lower than Mexico, South Africa, the Philippines, and Malaysia. Although China's level of innovation is high compared to other developing countries, China cannot effectively compete with developed countries with its low education rates.

Lastly, it is unclear whether the Chinese government's investment has been worth the return. Even with the United States' recent effort to bring semiconductor manufacturing back home, incentives for Chinese semiconductor companies dwarf those offered in America. Analyst Peter Cowhey puts it this way:

…the outsized Chinese government support for its semiconductor industry becomes even more starkly apparent when comparing the value of total funding assistance as a percentage of the nations'/regions' value of global semiconductor sales. By this measure, China's government assistance to its semiconductor industry is equivalent to 137 percent of the Chinese semiconductor industry's global sales, compared with just 11 percent for Japan, 3.8 percent for Taiwan, 2.3 percent for the European Union, and a miniscule 0.01 percent each for South Korea and the United States.

China's DSR and broader Belt and Road Initiative won't last without indigenous capabilities— and Beijing may be running out of time.

In October 2015, two years after a banking crisis left Cyprus in desperate need of new financing, President Nicos Anastasiades visited China on a charm offensive, touting the Mediterranean island's low tax rates, its European Union membership and its readiness to take part in China's Belt and Road Initiative, BRI.
The floodgates opened, but there was nothing sporadic about the Chinese outlay.
Today, money from Chinese state-owned or state-linked corporations has penetrated the core of just about every key Cypriot sector, from real estate to natural resources, transport to aviation, all in the name of a transcontinental infrastructure project linking countries along the route of the old Silk Road.
Thanks in part to the BRI, China is set to surpass the United States as the world's leading economy by 2028 and become the standout superpower heading into the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution.'
A key component of the BRI is the Digital Silk Road, DSR, through which the Chinese Communist Party seeks to develop and export key technological infrastructure – including 5G – to participating states, boosting the importance and presence of Chinese tech companies around the world and, to a degree, replicating its digital authoritarian model.
In Cyprus, according to BIRN's findings, China now dominates the 5G networks and the island's wider tech ecosystem, creating a key Chinese outpost inside the EU with potentially far-reaching consequences for data security and the independence of Cypriot – and by extension EU – foreign policy.
It is a state of affairs that contradicts U.S. and EU recommendations and the island's own claims to be pursuing a multi-vendor strategy.
5G underpins power grids, transportation, and water supplies, and, in the future, will enable military tools including artificial intelligence, said Carisa Nietsche, associate fellow for the Transatlantic Security Program at the Washington-based Centre for a New American Security.
'In extreme cases, analysts suspect China could pull the plug on the network, gather intelligence from data pulsing through the networks or cut off a 5G-enabled energy grid,' Nietsche told BIRN.

Building 5G on Chinese Foundations
On his 2015 visit to China, Anastasiades, who was re-elected in 2018, visited the Shanghai research center of Huawei, the world's largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment.
Huawei plays a key role in driving global industry standards in Beijing's favor through the filing of patents that make the industry more likely to adopt Chinese proposals as global standards.
In terms of 5G standard-essential patents, Huawei has the largest portfolio worldwide. The company claims to hold more commercial 5G contracts than any other telecom manufacturer in the world – 91. Forty-seven of these are in Europe.
At the research center, Anastasiades lauded Huawei's 'important contributions to communications network construction in Cyprus' and called for 'deeper ties'.

Huawei's dominance, however, has unsettled the United States and others, which say the company's equipment could be used by Beijing for spying, something Huawei has vigorously disputed.
In a rare interview with foreign media in 2019, Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei said: 'I love my country. I support the Communist Party. But I will not do anything to harm the world.' He said that Beijing had never asked him or Huawei to share 'improper information' about its partners and that he would 'never harm the interest' of his customers.
Unconvinced, in October 2020 then U.S. undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy, and the environment, Keith Krach, visited Nicosia and, with the 5G license application process underway in Cyprus, incorporated the island into the U.S. 'Clean Network' on 5G, an initiative launched under former President Donald Trump to build a global alliance excluding technology that Washington says can be manipulated by the Chinese Communist Party.
The Americans are concerned, in part, by the proximity of Chinese-dominated 5G networks to military bases. But while on paper the Cypriots may have sided with the Americans, in practice Huawei is still very much in play.
The company entered the local market in 2009, taking a lead role in the upgrade of the island's information and communications technology and the 2 or 3 or 4G infrastructure of its four telecommunications companies, CyTA, Epic, Cablenet, and Primetel.
Since Cyprus uses the so-called Non-Standalone, or NSA, mode for 5G – effectively building on top of its existing 4G infrastructure – and with Huawei providing the components for 100 percent of the telecom companies' 4G Radio Access Network, RAN – the Chinese giant looked perfectly placed last year to take the lead in the 5G rollout as well.
The RAN is comprised of various facilities such as cell towers and masts that connect users and devices to the Core Network, which in turn encompasses all 5G data exchanges such as authentication, security, session management, and traffic aggregation across devices.
In December 2020, the two biggest 5G contracts were awarded to CyTA and Epic.
But both companies, sources say, are overwhelmingly dependent on Huawei for their Core Network and their RAN infrastructure.
Semi-governmental CyTA launched its 5G Network in January 2021, catering to 70 percent of the population on launch and aiming for 98 percent coverage by the start of 2022.
A senior CyTA manager told BIRN that 80 percent of the company's Core Network and 100 percent of its RAN is covered by Huawei infrastructure. The remaining 20 percent of its Core Network is provided by Swedish Ericsson.
'CyTA is a governmental company and comes up with tenders for the equipment, and Huawei has been a long-term provider of infrastructure and support and offers the best prices,' said the senior manager, who asked not to be named since he was not authorized to speak to media.
Asked about the makeup of its Core Network and RAN infrastructure, CyTA told BIRN: 'We inform you that any information regarding the CyTA network is a trade secret and any disclosure of it is contrary to the commercial interests of CyTA and its partners (article 34 (2) Law 184 (I) / 2017).'
Huawei also accounts for 90 percent of Epic's Core Network infrastructure and 100 percent of the RAN, said a senior manager at Epic, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Epic's collaboration with Huawei dates to 2009, when the company, then named MTN, sealed a 20 million-euro contract with the Chinese firm to upgrade its network.
Now owned by Monaco Telecom, Epic went on to develop Cyprus's first 4G LTE network, leveraging Huawei's RAN solution, on which another Cypriot telecommunications firm, Primetel, also entered into an access-sharing agreement. In February 2019, shortly before its rebranding as Epic, MTN signed a deal with Huawei for the development of its 5G network.
An Epic spokesperson did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
Nietsche, of the Centre for a New American Security, told BIRN: 'For 5G to deliver on its promises of faster speeds, it requires an immense amount of data to travel through the network. And that data is pushed closer and closer to the end user, or the edge of the network.'
'In Europe, some governments have distinguished between the implementation of Huawei in the Core Network and the Radio Access Network, or edge of the network. These governments argue that you can essentially create a firewall between the core and edge of the network.'
'However, we should not make such a distinction. As 5G networks develop, more and more data is pushed toward the edge of the network, and it becomes harder to distinguish between the core and edge of the network.'
Chinese ‘Fusion'
Using Huawei components within 5G infrastructure is not a direct violation of European Union guidelines, since the EU toolbox on 5G – a common set of guidelines laid out by the bloc to limit 5G cybersecurity risks – did not explicitly ban any specific company but left it to member states to decide which providers were 'high-risk.'
Authorities in Cyprus have not as yet identified any provider as 'high-risk.'
The October 2020 memorandum of understanding that saw Cyprus sign up to the U.S. Clean Network 'does not imply in an implicit or explicit way that Cyprus will move away from Huawei', said the man who signed it, Deputy Minister for Research, Innovation and Digital Policy Kyriacos Kokkinos.
'What it says is that we will collaborate with U.S. agencies and authorities so that we ensure that the security standards are respected in the infrastructure we deploy,' Kokkinos told BIRN.
EU guidelines, however, do stress caution over suppliers 'subject to interference from a non-EU country', warning that a member state's network could be vulnerable if there was a 'strong link between the supplier and a government of a third country.'

Huawei's state ties are considerable.
Ren, the company's founder, was a former Deputy Regimental Chief of the People's Liberation Army; reports say that a considerable number of Huawei employees are believed to have worked for the military; and some Huawei employees have collaborated on research projects with military personnel.
But it was legislation passed in China in 2017 that really raised eyebrows.
Article 7 of China's 2017 National Intelligence Law requires any organization to support, provide assistance and cooperate in 'national intelligence work'. Even before that, Article 22 of the 2014 Counter-Espionage Law required any 'relevant organizations and individuals' to 'truthfully provide' information during any 'counter-espionage investigation'.
China's 'military-civil fusion'–which calls for private sector assistance in the country's military objectives – was inscribed as a strategic priority in the Chinese Communist Party's constitution in October 2017.
Some European countries have already balked.
In October, Swedish telecom regulator PTS banned Huawei from supplying 5G equipment to Swedish mobile firms due to security concerns raised by Sweden's SAP security service, a decision upheld by a Swedish court in June this year.
Huawei has repeatedly denied posing a security threat, while China threatened 'all necessary measures' in response to the Swedish ban. Beijing also told France and Germany not to 'discriminate' against the company.
In the United Kingdom, a firm US ally, the government set a cap of 35 percent limit on Huawei's involvement in 5G RAN. It also excluded Huawei from safety-related and safety-critical networks and sensitive locations such as nuclear sites and military bases.
In Cyprus, Kokkinos would not be drawn on whether Cyprus might set a similar cap.
'I don't want to make a statement that might be misleading that this is not something that might happen in the future,' he said. 'But at the moment we do not exclude any vendor.'
Critics of the Chinese government say the stakes could not be higher.
Given how much states and societies will come to depend on fifth-generation technology, its security poses an unprecedented challenge, with any potential 'hack' snowballing into a threat to national security.
As a host to British military bases and U.S. spy stations at the crossroads of Europe, Asia and the Middle East, Cyprus is no 'island' when it comes to geostrategic importance. Some experts say the threat posed by Huawei's political and military ties and its data dominance in Cyprus cannot be ignored.
'One day Cyprus has to choose a side,' said Chen Yonglin, a former Chinese consular official in Sydney, Australia, whose work included monitoring Chinese dissidents until he defected in 2005. 'One day China will take off its mask and Cyprus won't be able to stand in the middle.'
'Cyprus needs to be careful about handing over its sovereignty to China,' he told BIRN.
John Strand, director and founder of telecommunications consultancy firm Strand Consult, concurred:
'The China we have today is a different China than we had five years ago,' he said. 'China is a country which is very aggressive to countries which basically have an opinion, or have citizens who have an opinion about what is going on in China, Hong Kong or Tibet, and other places.'
'We have seen that China is not only threatening countries which go against them or criticize them, they also punish countries,' he told BIRN.
'If the Internet broke down 10 to 15 years ago, society could move on, it was not an issue.

November 30th, by Daniel Russel and Blake Berger

Beijing's declared goal of becoming a 'cyber great power' manifests itself in policies aimed at rivaling or surpassing the West in the competition to develop next-generation technology and to promote its global adoption.

An under-appreciated aspect of this effort has been the deliberate strategy to increase China's influence within international standards development organizations (SDOs). Through various tactics, Beijing has significantly enhanced its ability to gain approval of its own proposals and to resist those that it does not favor. Beijing has lobbied hard for key roles in the bureaucracy of international SDOs. And while the Belt and Road Initiative has been the focus of much research, including the Asia Society Policy Institute's (ASPI) 'Navigating the Belt and Road' series, far less attention has been given to its technological artery, the Digital Silk Road (DSR), which supports the export of Chinese telecommunication technologies and other high-tech systems.

The ASPI report, Stacking the Deck: China's Influence in International Technology Standards Setting, examines how the DSR policies, the PRC's standardization strategy, and Beijing's advocacy in the United Nations and standards development bodies aim to produce geostrategic, commercial, and technological advantages for China. This report further explains how these strategies not only serve the PRC's commercial interests, but also bolster its push for 'cyber sovereignty' instead of the free flow of ideas, information, and data. Lastly, this report offers actionable policy recommendations for governments, including the U.S., for protecting a merit-based international standardization system and a free and open internet.

40;BRI: Digital know-how along China's BRI will set future global tech standards;Staff Writer, ZAWYA;2022-01-02 05:31:10;full;https://www.zawya.com/mena/en/business/story/BRI_Digital_knowhow_along_Chinas_BRI_will_set_future_global_tech_standards-ZAWYA20220102052332;zawya.com;China is investing heavily in digital connectivity along the BRI;"China's growing technological expertise along its digital silk road is expected to set benchmarks for the rest of the world to follow, according to analysts.President Xi's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) started down the digital silk road long before the rest of the world began talking about connected smart cities and technology driven solutions.As China continues to expand its digital footprint in sectors as diverse as cloud computing, 5G, surveillance technology and virtual currency, observers see movement in some areas toward Chinese technological dominance.Dale Aluf, Director of Research & Strategy at SIGNAL (Sino-Israel Global Network & Academic Leadership) said China is already leading the world in artificial intelligence, blockchain, 5G, and quantum technology publications and patents. 'Data fuels AI development and, thanks to its sprawling surveillance apparatus, China has access to immense amounts of it, so China seems well-positioned to emerge as a leader in this field.'China has already launched the biggest blockchain ecosystem in the world, connected to over 100 city nodes, and was the first country to launch widespread pilots of a digital fiat currency - the Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) system.Analysts agree that China has achieved enormous breakthroughs in some future technologies.'These advancements in technologies allow China to more efficiently promote the progress of BRI, increase the bonding between China and BRI countries, and push BRI's hard projects,' said Walter Wang, Consulting Director at research and consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, in Greater China.Wang cited China's world-leading fibre optic industry, which is already assisting BRI countries in transforming from traditional to renewable energy supplies.Many countries aligned with BRI are rich in solar energy resources, but 'lack the technologies and resources to construct renewable energy infrastructure,' according to Wang.'Through BRI, China can export advanced renewable energy technologies to BRI countries and Chinese fibre optic enterprises are able to enjoy local preferential policies, including tax incentives, preferential treatment for equipment imports,' he added. According to Frost & Sullivan research, in some infrastructure areas, such as high-speed railway, 5G networks, and ultra-high voltage power grids, China's standards have become the international standards as everyone else plays catch-up.'Therefore, through collaborating with Chinese enterprises, BRI partner countries can adopt the technologies that accord with the most advanced standards in their infrastructure projects,' said Wang.Impact on BRIAccording to SIGNAL's Aluf, China's technological prowess gives it an edge to push BRI's hard projects, such as renewable energy, transportation, infrastructure, power, and healthcare since in today's technology-driven world, the digital realm is intimately intertwined with hard infrastructure.'Railways, ports, and electricity grids, for instance, would not be able to operate effectively today without software, sensors, and cybersecurity,' he notedMoreover, China also provides a useful reference for BRI countries with its digital transformation and industrial digitalisation models.Wang said most BRI countries are developing countries and have limited experience in dealing with digital technology but can benefit from China's digitalisation experiences.He gave the example of the Silk Road E-commerce platform that China developed together with 22 BRI countries in 2016. During the COVID-19 pandemic, China, and those aligned with the BRI, quickly adjusted their strategies, switching focus from offline to an online market, while exploiting the advantages of cross-border e-commerce platforms, creating more new growth points for the economic development of BRI countries.In the future, Wang expects China to continue assisting BRI countries to improve their 5G infrastructure, the foundation of future digital transformation, and to promote their digital economies, such as popularising mobile payments to facilitate loan processes for SMBs and therefore alleviate 'urgent need' financing during the pandemic.How technology will be incorporated into BRI projects will depend very much on the nature of the projects, according to Jia Hao Chan, a research associate at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore.'And this will differ among regions and countries,' he said.For instance, in late 2017, Chinese company Huawei Marine partnered with the Pakistani authorities to start constructing the Pakistan East Africa Cable Express, which will connect Pakistan to Kenya and Djibouti, focusing on hard infrastructure interconnectivity.'This is essentially different from the areas China is looking out for in Southeast Asia (focusing on IT services, soft infrastructure), where tech companies like Alibaba and Didi Chuxing would collaborate with regional ride-hailing services like Grab, through investment partnerships.' TECHNOLOGY EXPORTSGiven that the BRI is primarily a financing/investment mechanism, analysts at Fitch Solutions believe exporting technology simply adds a different dimension to the entire BRI assistance package.'Broadly speaking, most BRI projects have already been dependent on using Chinese equipment and labour, so any kind of tech advancement might just mean higher quality or more efficient projects,' said Daine Loh, Analyst, Infrastructure and Power & Renewables, Fitch Solutions.She pointed out that things like 5G and AI are still in their early adoption stage in the broader infrastructure sector, adding, 'we do not expect it to be widely used yet'.Loh said anything digital will tend to also require a larger investment amount, and 'the financial capacity of BRI recipient markets will come into question here as well, especially if these markets are prioritising developing adequate infrastructure to meet their domestic needs first'.The best way for BRI partner countries to benefit from China's technological prowess is to partner with Chinese operators, according to Chris Devonshire Ellis, Chairman of Dezan Shira & Associates.'In the West, the capitalist system has focused too much on profits and not enough on cashflow business and service lines. The Chinese are developing technologies to hook their services into supply chains to generate cash flow streams. That is a very sustainable business model,' he said.LIMITS TO SHARINGWhile China has achieved digital supremacy in some areas of future tech, how much of it will be shared with its BRI partner countries remains to be seen. While developing countries should be able to take advantage of ICT infrastructure, China 'will not share in the ownership of the technology that drives the infrastructure,' according to Andre Wheeler.'The technology is owned by China under its National Security legislative provisions. This may act as a barrier to future trade for these developing countries as they may be restricted in how they can conduct trade with the likes of the EU,' said Wheeler, who is also the chief executive of Asia Pacific Connex.The Digital Silk Road, and the BRI is a supply-driven project, noted researcher Chan. He added that China's technological offers do not guarantee the same level of adoption (demand) of tech goods and services across its partner countries.'Moreover, there could be a lag effect in tech exports, where certain technologies gain a foothold in the Chinese market before they are deployed elsewhere.'Hence, Chan suggested that BRI partner countries themselves should carefully consider 'what they really need' and not merely 'take whatever is put on the table'. 'They also should consider their own ability to adopt the technologies they want, and their rate of innovation if they are going to attain competitive advantage in the long run.'According to Wheeler, the digital silk road is the integrator of trade along the BRI – something that is being developed to create an integrated and seamless trade platform with all BRI participants.'It is powerful in that it targets the key merge points in transport systems, particularly ports and rail.'However, he points out that the shortcomings in the DSR/BRI integration could limit China to BRI partner countries or a regional role.Whilst the EU–China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) agreement in principle was heralded in January as a means of cooperation, Wheeler said there is also significant pushback from the EU, with regards to the recently introduced EU-Connectivity strategy that has led to the likes of Huawei being banned as a network provider in EU digital connectivity initiatives.MAKING INROADSBut many countries are already enjoying the benefits of China's augmentation of infrastructure and tech.Aluf of SIGNAL pointed out that several Middle Eastern countries are cooperating with China on smart city technology, and there is even a project designed to streamline the experiences of pilgrims travelling to Mecca and Medina.'China's 2Africa initiative, among the largest subsea projects in the world, aims to connect 23 countries in Africa, the Middle East and Europe with a resource-efficient fibre optic cable that uses Spatial Division Multiplexing technology,' he added.Meanwhile, its SeaMeWe-5 undersea cable is expected to carry telecommunications between Singapore and France.According to Frost & Sullivan's Wang, most BRI partner countries have outdated data infrastructure, which means operational efficiency is low and maintenance costs are relatively expensive.For long-term development, these countries will need to upgrade their existing infrastructure as well as initiate new infrastructure projects.'China, as a pioneer, can provide these countries with the necessary technologies, financing and, more importantly, practical experiences,' said Wang.For example, he said, China and the Republic of Belarus have jointly built industrial parks based on the industrial Internet. China also has transportation and internet infrastructure upgrading projects in Iran, Pakistan, Vietnam, Brazil, and Malaysia. 'Thus, with the support from China, BRI partner countries will accelerate their infrastructure upgrading process and build up their information systems,' added Wang.BEYOND TECH SUPREMACY China's dominance over future technologies will continue to grow but one overlooked aspect of the BRI, according to Ellis, is that it will turn China into a global supply chain middleman.'It is not just making products and building the infrastructure, it will operate much of it. 'Everything someone buys in Paris or London will have a price component that will have been charged by a Chinese business,' he said.While there seems to be a tendency for observers to focus on specific technologies and their impacts on a given tech or economic sector, Aluf insists that the true power of these technologies is unleashed through their augmentation.For example, by combining embedded sensors, metering devices, cameras, and other surveillance tech with big data processing and aggregated data analysis, he said China has emerged at the forefront of smart city development. 'The same can be said for its fintech sector, with companies like Huawei, Tencent, and Alibaba leading the way.'With China doubling down on achieving carbon neutrality, Aluf said it is also expected to pump significant resources into the development of clean technologies and renewable energy.FUTURE INVESTMENTS In terms of investment under BRI, China is likely to increase its funding for soft infrastructure under the Digital Silk Route but said it does not necessarily have to be in the form of intergovernmental (G2G), government-to-business (G2B) or an industry-wide coordinated approach. 'They can be in the form of B2B at company level.'He said Chinese tech companies are already investing in many local/regional tech companies.At government level, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in March declared that China will increase its spending on research and development by more than 7 percent over the next five years in a push to make major breakthroughs in advanced technology.At the same time, as part of its post-COVID-19 relief package, Aluf says China is ramping up plans to construct digital infrastructure grids across the country – including building 5G networks, artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), intercity high-speed rail, and setting up research and development institutions.'Considering the importance of China's international digital expansion in the context of its global strategy, I think it's very likely that China will increase funding for digital infrastructure under the banner of its Digital Silk Road,' he added.While the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected the world economy, China's non-financial outward foreign direct investment in BRI partner countries remained strong and positive, reaching $17.8 billion in 2020, an 18.3 percent increase from 2019, stated Frost & Sullivan.In the first half of 2021, China's non-financial outward foreign direct investment in BRI partner countries continued growing to $9.6 billion, with a growth rate of 8.6 percent.'Based on historical data, we consider China's spending on BRI partner countries will keep rising, and the cooperation between them will be more effective and comprehensive,' said Wang.In the foreseeable future, he said communications and data infrastructure levels of BRI partner countries will largely influence the development of BRI. 'Therefore, China will continue raising the funding in soft infrastructure to ensure the success of BRI.'WEAK SPOTSBut China's quest for technological leadership is not without its challenges. A weak spot is technology hardware that allows future technologies to work, like for instance, microprocessor/semi-conductor capacity, which involves fitting more transistors on a single microchip to effectively handle the large data flow/information exchange.Wheeler pointed out that chip design is dominated by the US and South Korea, with five of the top seven design centres US-owned, while Taiwan and South Korea, between them, control 75 percent of world semi-conductor manufacturing capacity.'China is currently trying to change the agenda to the discussion, not on technology development, but to argue for better chip utility. This is a significant issue as integrated circuitry and chip technology is central to smartphone development and use in IoT/AI etc – and is a significant hurdle to China as they move to develop a more advanced 6G network,' he explained.Aluf noted that China's push to achieve technological supremacy and drive global standards has raised concerns in some quarters.'Against the backdrop of renewed great power competition, the West, and particularly America, is determined to maintain a lead over the development and standard setting for emerging technologies,' he said.He opined that America's Build Back Better (B3W) plan, projected to be worth $7 trillion, may serve as a counterweight to the BRI.'If successful, it could dilute the influence of BRI projects - including those in the digital realm,' he said.(Writing by SA Kader; Editing by Charles Lavery and Anoop Menon) (anoop.menon@refinitiv.com)  © ZAWYA 2022";zawya.com;8043;news;AE;en;Staff Writer;https://www.zawya.com/images/cia/zAmp/180620130010CTNU.jpg;False;@Zawya;23.064348;945b8c7fa4c2977f07b1d3d2b353dd42;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND DSR', 'lang': 'en', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'from': '3 years ago', 'sort_by': 'date', 'page': 1}

In Dakar, where the forum was held, China is funding and building a data centre to host Senegal's government data and digital platforms, which will move from servers in the US and Europe. Tech giant Huawei Technologies is building and supplying the centre's equipment, at a cost of 46 billion CFA francs (US$79 million) through a Chinese government loan. Senegalese President Macky Sall has said the move will boost his country's digital sovereignty.

 Abhishek Mishra, associate fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi, said the Senegal project was important because it was the first time any African country had replicated China's data governance model. ""The risk is that while Senegal will now control all the information, mimicking a surveillance state, the country's entire digital infrastructure would be subsequently dependent on Chinese technology,"" he said. ""Huawei's handling of such sensitive information positions China in a place of data superiority."" Biden signs legislation to tighten US restrictions on Huawei and ZTE Mishra said the data centre was not the only example of Africa's move towards a Chinese digital model. In June, Nigeria banned Twitter, drawing parallels with China for the censorship model it is developing. The Senegal data centre is just one of many being built by Chinese companies in Africa to keep pace with the economic and social transformation which is exerting considerable pressure on the continent's existing infrastructure, according to Mishra. The Africa Data Centres Association estimates 1,000MW capacity and 700 new centres will be needed. Huawei has either completed or is building multimillion-dollar data centres and cloud services in a number of African countries, including Zimbabwe, Zambia, Togo, Tanzania, Mozambique, Mali and Madagascar. Chinese and US diplomats are jostling for influence in Africa The Chinese tech giant is also powering 5G in Africa. The continent's first 5G stand-alone commercial network is live in South Africa and Kenya, with trials ongoing in other countries. The current 4G infrastructure depends to a large extent on support provided by Huawei. In a move which could determine control of internet communication infrastructure, Chinese companies - including China Mobile, HMN Tech (formerly Huawei Technologies Co. Marine) and Hengtong Group - are backing construction of two undersea fibre optic cables. The 15,000km (9,320 miles) Pakistan and East Africa Connecting to Europe (Peace) cable has key landing points in France, Pakistan and Kenya, with plans to extend to South Africa in its second phase. It is owned by Peace Cable International Network, a subsidiary of Chinese firm Hengtong Group, with equipment supplied by HMN Tech. Can China's 'digital silk road' secure dominant role in communications? A second cable - 2Africa - is expected to go live in 2023 or early 2024 and serve the continent and the Middle East. Together, the two cables will offer the fastest communications route between China, Africa, Europe and the Middle East. The 37,000km 2Africa cable is being built for an estimated US$1 billion by China Mobile International - a subsidiary of the world's largest mobile phone operator China Mobile - and other mobile operators including MTN GlobalConnect, Orange, and Vodafone. According to Mishra, two things underline the DSR - the Chinese Communist Party's view of the digital domain as its next key sector for force projection, and its goal to prevent global digital value chains from being controlled by the West. ""By supporting regional digital infrastructure and projects that integrate the internet, big data and AI, if such projects in Africa are successful in modernising Africa's various industrial sectors, then it creates a 1.2 billion [people] market for its digital goods and integrates the regional industrial architecture,"" he said. ""This is all the more important since e-commerce and fintech are bound to drive national economic trajectories in African countries, particularly as the pandemic has prompted a shift towards digitalisation."" There is a commercial and strategic logic to the digital belt and road in Africa, according to Eyck Freymann, author of One Belt One Road: Chinese Power Meets the World. Africa - with its young and fast-growing population, low levels of internet penetration and huge opportunities in areas like fintech, e-commerce and agricultural tech - was recognised by Chinese tech companies as a big potential market for electronics and digital services, he said. According to Freymann, despite its recent crackdown on Big Tech, China wants to internationalise its technological platforms and experiment with things like cross-border payments using digital renminbi. Chinese smartphone users lose 1.7 million apps in 3 years ""Africa is an ideal sandbox for Chinese tech firms looking to expand abroad without raising alarms in Washington,"" he said. Analyst Rebecca Arcesati, with the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin, said deepening China's integration with high-growth digital ecosystems across developing and emerging economies had numerous advantages from Beijing's viewpoint. ""It is very much in line with China's economic development and innovation strategy, which aims to turn the country into a hi-tech exporter and global leader in emerging technologies, as well as a rule-maker in the digital economy,"" she said. ""Africa is a key market whose technology choices are poised to shape tomorrow's standards and norms in important ways."" According to Arcesati, Beijing is executing its strategy by piggybacking off commercial actors. The party-state was also seeking to control more global networks and data flows, leveraging countries' dependence on Chinese technology to gain geopolitical influence, she said. ""It is no coincidence that Xi Jinping has highlighted the importance of smart city cooperation with African partners for years. The growing integration of the internet of things with urban infrastructure multiplies opportunities for data collection."" Robert Greene, a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace's Cyber Policy Initiative and Asia Programme, said Beijing was seeking to play a leading role in standard-setting for cyberspace governance and emerging technologies, including digital currencies. ""For years, Beijing has been trying to project a view of 'cyber sovereignty' that is fundamentally at odds with how the US and other democracies conceptualise what the internet should be,"" he said. Xi renews 'cyber sovereignty' call at China's internet event of the year According to Greene, Beijing's vision of cyber sovereignty refers to a paradigm in which national governments maintain a significant degree of autonomy, controlling content and governance over cyberspace within their borders. ""Beijing provides direct and indirect support to Chinese technology companies to help facilitate the proliferation of a 'made in China' tech stack."" Greene said Beijing had accelerated efforts in recent years to spread its vision of cyber sovereignty in emerging markets under the banner of the digital silk road. China's investments in Africa's tech is also bound up in its geopolitical rivalry with the US which, along with some of its allies, banned Huawei on security grounds. Huawei rejects Washington's accusations, including claims it was allowing the Chinese government access to its equipment to spy on voice and data traffic. Arcesati said Huawei had lost a lot of ground in the wireless equipment market outside China, but those losses were concentrated in advanced economies that have restricted the company's role in their 5G network roll-outs, such as Australia and many European countries. ""As their governments' national security concerns push the company away from these markets, the importance of Africa's developing and emerging economies to Chinese vendors is greater than ever,"" she said. Arcesati said the Huawei issue was not merely a case of an ICT firm reorienting its business strategy following some setbacks. The company is also China's national champion and the centrepiece of the government's plan to achieve global dominance in 5G. ""China's political and legal system is increasingly fuelling distrust of Chinese technology firms in Europe and elsewhere, a trend that will only deepen with the new data laws and the party-state's moves to strengthen control over private tech giants,"" she said. ""As a result, for Chinese leaders strengthening ties with developing and emerging economies in the digital economy is strategically vital.""

 Since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak, China has been stressing digital economy cooperation with its partners in the global South at every virtual major regional summit, from FOCAC to Asean. ""There is a growing focus on promoting normative and regulatory alignment, particularly in the area of data governance,"" Arcesati said. ""China sees African countries as essential partners in the creation of a global rule book for the digital economy, one that more closely aligns with its preferences as opposed to a framework written by the West."" Xi plays up roles for private sector in China-Africa trade and finance According to Mishra, from the Observer Research Foundation, China's focus on Africa has also been driven by the setbacks in 5G and communications tech, not just in the US and Europe, but also India - which banned 59 Chinese apps - and Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines and Vietnam. ""African countries need to ensure they don't get embroiled between major power rivalries. The political fragmentation and commoditisation of the internet and broadband would be bad news,"" he said. But he added that it was also important to acknowledge the reality that Africa needed these technologies. ""Africa needs network infrastructure, and China is present and is responsible for making 70 per cent of the continent's network infrastructure. Africans also need affordable handsets and behold, China is making 50 per cent of the continent's handsets,"" Mishra said. Huawei is Africa's largest network provider while Transsion, maker of Tecno, Infinix and Itel brands, is the top seller of mobile phone handsets in the continent.

Greek Bos/Hrv/Srp In October 2015, two years after a banking crisis left Cyprus in desperate need of new financing, President Nicos Anastasiades visited China on a charm offensive, touting the Mediterranean island's low tax rates, its European Union membership and its readiness to take part in China's Belt and Road Initiative, BRI.
The floodgates opened, but there was nothing sporadic about the Chinese outlay.
Today, money from Chinese state-owned or state-linked corporations has penetrated the core of just about every key Cypriot sector, from real estate to natural resources, transport to aviation, all in the name of a transcontinental infrastructure project linking countries along the route of the old Silk Road.

Thanks in part to the BRI, China is set to surpass the United States as the world's leading economy by 2028 and become the standout superpower heading into the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution.'
A key component of the BRI is the Digital Silk Road, DSR, through which the Chinese Communist Party seeks to develop and export key technological infrastructure – including 5G – to participating states, boosting the importance and presence of Chinese tech companies around the world and, to a degree, replicating its digital authoritarian model.

In Cyprus, according to BIRN's findings, China now dominates the 5G networks and the island's wider tech ecosystem, creating a key Chinese outpost inside the EU with potentially far-reaching consequences for data security and the independence of Cypriot – and by extension EU – foreign policy.
It is a state of affairs that contradicts US and EU recommendations and the island's own claims to be pursuing a multi-vendor strategy.
5G underpins power grids, transportation and water supplies, and, in the future, will enable military tools including artificial intelligence, said Carisa Nietsche, associate fellow for the Transatlantic Security Program at the Washington-based Centre for a New American Security.
'In extreme cases, analysts suspect China could pull the plug on the network, gather intelligence from data pulsing through the networks or cut off a 5G-enabled energy grid,' Nietsche told BIRN.

Chinese investment in Cyprus
In 2015, China's largest private copper smelter, Yanggu Xiangguang Copper, bought a 22 per cent stake in Cyprus-registered copper mining company Atalaya Mining Plc for 96.2 million euros.
In November 2019, a consortium led by state-owned China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering signed a 290 million-euro deal with the Cypriot natural gas infrastructure company ETYFA to build a liquefied natural gas terminal for electricity generation. Among the four firms in the consortium is state-owned Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding, the top warship producer for the Chinese navy.
Before it pulled out in 2019, state-owned Aviation Industry Corp. of China, AVIC, was the largest shareholder in Cypriot airline Cobalt.
JimChang Global Group has invested 100 million euros in a five-star hotel and housing development near Ayia Napa via a joint venture announced in 2016 with Cyprus property group Giovani. The residential part was completed last year.
Macau-based Melco is investing $677 million in the City of Dreams Mediterranean, an ‘integrated casino resort' in Limassol, Cyprus. It is expected to open in 2022.

On his 2015 visit to China, Anastasiades, who was re-elected in 2018, visited the Shanghai research centre of Huawei, the world's largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment.
Huawei plays a key role in driving global industry standards in Beijing's favour through the filing of patents that make the industry more likely to adopt Chinese proposals as global standards.
In terms of 5G standard essential patents, Huawei has the largest portfolio worldwide. The company claims to hold more commercial 5G contracts than any other telecom manufacturer in the world – 91. Forty-seven of these are in Europe.
At the research centre, Anastasiades lauded Huawei's 'important contributions to communications network construction in Cyprus' and called for 'deeper ties'.
Huawei's dominance, however, has unsettled the United States and others, which say the company's equipment could be used by Beijing for spying, something Huawei has vigorously disputed.
In a rare interview with foreign media in 2019, Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei said: 'I love my country. I support the Communist Party. But I will not do anything to harm the world.' He said that Beijing had never asked him or Huawei to share 'improper information' about its partners and that he would 'never harm the interest' of his customers.
Unconvinced, in October 2020 then US undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and the environment, Keith Krach, visited Nicosia and, with the 5G licence application process underway in Cyprus, incorporated the island into the US ‘Clean Network' on 5G, an initiative launched under former President Donald Trump to build a global alliance excluding technology that Washington says can be manipulated by the Chinese Communist Party.
The Americans are concerned, in part, by the proximity of Chinese-dominated 5G networks to military bases. But while on paper the Cypriots may have sided with the Americans, in practice Huawei is still very much in play.

The company entered the local market in 2009, taking a lead role in the upgrade of the island's information and communications technology and the 2/3/4G infrastructure of its four telecommunications companies, CyTA, Epic, Cablenet and Primetel.
Since Cyprus uses the so-called Non-Standalone, or NSA, mode for 5G – effectively building on top of its existing 4G infrastructure – and with Huawei providing the components for 100 per cent of the telecom companies' 4G Radio Access Network, RAN – the Chinese giant looked perfectly placed last year to take the lead in the 5G rollout as well.
The RAN is comprised of various facilities such as cell towers and masts that connect users and devices to the Core Network, which in turn encompasses all 5G data exchanges such as authentication, security, session management and traffic aggregation across devices.
In December 2020, the two biggest 5G contracts were awarded to CyTA and Epic.
But both companies, sources say, are overwhelmingly dependent on Huawei for their Core Network and their RAN infrastructure.
Semi-governmental CyTA launched its 5G Network in January 2021, catering to 70 per cent of the population on launch and aiming for 98 per cent coverage by the start of 2022.
A senior CyTA manager told BIRN that 80 per cent of the company's Core Network and 100 per cent of its RAN is covered by Huawei infrastructure. The remaining 20 per cent of its Core Network is provided by Swedish Ericsson.
'CyTA is a governmental company and comes up with tenders for the equipment, and Huawei has been a long-term provider of infrastructure and support and offers the best prices,' said the senior manager, who asked not to be named since he was not authorised to speak to media.
Asked about the makeup of its Core Network and RAN infrastructure, CyTA told BIRN: 'We inform you that any information regarding the CyTA network is a trade secret and any disclosure of it is contrary to the commercial interests of CyTA and its partners (article 34 (2) Law 184 (I) / 2017).'
Huawei also accounts for 90 per cent of Epic's Core Network infrastructure and 100 per cent of the RAN, said a senior manager at Epic, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Epic's collaboration with Huawei dates to 2009, when the company, then named MTN, sealed a 20 million-euro contract with the Chinese firm to upgrade its network.
Now owned by Monaco Telecom, Epic went on to develop Cyprus's first 4G LTE network, leveraging Huawei's RAN solution, on which another Cypriot telecommunications firm, Primetel, also entered into an access-sharing agreement. In February 2019, shortly before its rebranding as Epic, MTN signed a deal with Huawei for the development of its 5G network.
An Epic spokesperson did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
Nietsche, of the Centre for a New American Security, told BIRN: 'For 5G to deliver on its promises of faster speeds, it requires an immense amount of data to travel through the network. And that data is pushed closer and closer to the end user, or the edge of the network.'
'In Europe, some governments have distinguished between implementation of Huawei in the Core Network and the Radio Access Network, or edge of the network. These governments argue that you can essentially create a firewall between the core and edge of the network.'
'However, we should not make such a distinction. As 5G networks develop, more and more data is pushed toward the edge of the network, and it becomes harder to distinguish between the core and edge of the network.'
Chinese ‘fusion'

Using Huawei components within 5G infrastructure is not a direct violation of European Union guidelines, since the EU toolbox on 5G – a common set of guidelines laid out by the bloc to limit 5G cybersecurity risks – did not explicitly ban any specific company but left it to member states to decide which providers were ‘high-risk'.
Authorities in Cyprus have not as yet identified any provider as ‘high-risk'.
The October 2020 memorandum of understanding that saw Cyprus sign up to the US Clean Network 'does not imply in an implicit or explicit way that Cyprus will move away from Huawei', said the man who signed it, Deputy Minister for Research, Innovation and Digital Policy Kyriacos Kokkinos.
'What it says is that we will collaborate with US agencies and authorities so that we ensure that the security standards are respected in the infrastructure we deploy,' Kokkinos told BIRN.
EU guidelines, however, do stress caution over suppliers 'subject to interference from a non-EU country', warning that a member state's network could be vulnerable if there was a 'strong link between the supplier and a government of a third country.'
Huawei's state ties are considerable.
Zhengfei, the company's founder, was a former Deputy Regimental Chief of the People's Liberation Army; reports say that a considerable number of Huawei employees are believed to have worked for the military; and some Huawei employees have collaborated on research projects with military personnel.
But it was legislation passed in China in 2017 that really raised eyebrows.
Article 7 of China's 2017 National Intelligence Law requires any organisation to support, provide assistance and cooperate in 'national intelligence work'. Even before that, Article 22 of the 2014 Counter-Espionage Law required any 'relevant organisations and individuals' to 'truthfully provide' information during any 'counter-espionage investigation'.
China's 'military-civil fusion' – which calls for private sector assistance in the country's military objectives – was inscribed as a strategic priority in the Chinese Communist Party's constitution in October 2017.
Some European countries have already balked.
In October, Swedish telecom regulator PTS banned Huawei from supplying 5G equipment to Swedish mobile firms due to security concerns raised by Sweden's SAP security service, a decision upheld by a Swedish court in June this year.
Huawei has repeatedly denied posing a security threat, while China threatened 'all necessary measures' in response to the Swedish ban. Beijing also told France and Germany not to 'discriminate' against the company.
In the United Kingdom, a firm US ally, the government set a cap of 35 per cent limit on Huawei's involvement in 5G RAN. It also excluded Huawei from safety-related and safety critical networks and sensitive locations such as nuclear sites and military bases.
In Cyprus, Kokkinos would not be drawn on whether Cyprus might set a similar cap.
'I don't want to make a statement that might be misleading that this is not something that might happen in the future,' he said. 'But at the moment we do not exclude any vendor.'
Critics of the Chinese government say the stakes could not be higher.
Given how much states and societies will come to depend on fifth generation technology, its security poses an unprecedented challenge, with any potential ‘hack' snowballing into a threat to national security.
As a host to British military bases and US spy stations at the crossroads of Europe, Asia and the Middle East, Cyprus is no ‘island' when it comes to geostrategic importance. Some experts say the threat posed by Huawei's political and military ties and its data dominance in Cyprus cannot be ignored.
'One day Cyprus has to choose a side,' said Chen Yonglin, a former Chinese consular official in Sydney, Australia, whose work included monitoring Chinese dissidents until he defected in 2005. 'One day China will take off its mask and Cyprus won't be able to stand in the middle.'
'Cyprus needs to be careful about handing over its sovereignty to China,' he told BIRN.
John Strand, director and founder of telecommunications consultancy firm Strand Consult, concurred:
'The China we have today is a different China than we had five years ago,' he said. 'China is a country which is very aggressive to countries which basically have an opinion, or have citizens who have an opinion about what is going on in China, Hong Kong or Tibet, and other places.'

There is a heated debate about the social-sustainability implications of infrastructure. We engage this debate by delving into China's Digital Silk Road (DSR), an important component of China's infrastructure-centric Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Optimists and pessimists have offered strong views about the DSR's social-sustainability implications. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of analytical tools and in-depth studies which can be used to judge their competing arguments. In this article, we address these problems in two ways. First, we advance an original scheme for operationalizing social sustainability. Second, we use our framework to systematically analyze the DSR's social-sustainability effects in Ethiopia, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates, and Hungary. Our research indicates that much of the positive and negative commentary about the DSR's social-sustainability implications is problematic. None of our cases show significant year-to-year changes in political or quality-of-life social-sustainability benchmarks. Indeed, our analysis indicates that analysts must pay close attention to the political and economic context to understand the social-sustainability patterns associated with DSR infrastructure. Finally, it suggests that the social-sustainability implications of DSR infrastructure are dependent on its scale and nature. These findings have ramifications for broader debates about the socioeconomic impact of infrastructure.

At...;Trade show attendees test out a tabletop-scale demo of Huawei's Smart Port 5G automation system (Huawei) Published Nov 7, 2021 9:55 PM by Brian Gicheru Kinyua How the Digital Silk Road is Digitizing Shipping with China as the Sole Network Administrator. At the heart of US dominance as an information empire back in 20th century was the AT&T Company. For decades, AT&T deployed its expertise to solve some of the most complex and sensitive telecommunications puzzles of the era. This included helping to develop nuclear weapons technology, a ballistic missile warning system and a secret communications network for Air Force One.   In the 1930s, AT&T was also responsible for ship to shore radiotelephone system, which consisted of high seas service stations dotting the Pacific and the Atlantic Coasts, operating under the WOO call-sign. In those days before the satellite technology became widely available, mariners could only communicate using telephone calls placed by contacting an AT&T marine operator on VHF (Very High Frequency) channels. The contours of shipping's telecommunication technology have changed from the historical era of AT&T dominance and are shifting to a future one, which seems imprinted in China's Digital Silk Road (DSR). DSR is the largest deployment of transnational digital infrastructure ever witnessed. Its backbone is thousands of miles of subsea fiber optic cables beneath the world's oceans. The nerve center is China's 'Big Three' state owned telecommunications firms - China Telecom, China Unicom and China Mobile. They assist in carrying, storing and mining of data passing through the subsea cables encircling the earth, while at the same time keeping China's networks out of foreigners' reach. Essentially, these firms are doing the final leg of China's global physical footprint through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). For every visible Chinese investment in transport infrastructure, there is an invisible attempt to streamline its digital dimension. Take the case of the Chinese-controlled Piraeus port in Greece. The benefit of the investment is not just in expanding the port's physical capacity, but its network systems have also been overhauled courtesy of Huawei. This is in addition to installing routers, which are now supplying free Wi-Fi to the port's staff and tourists at the cruise terminal. As Jonathan Hillman says in a new book, The Digital Silk Road: China's Quest to Wire the World and Win the Future, 'China has been packaging digital infrastructure with the traditional infrastructure, and the world desperately needs both.' In September, Huawei launched its Smart Port solution during the Huawei CONNECT 2021 forum. It is targeting the countries building world-class ports, and it wants to deploy the technology in making cargo handling more intelligent and convenient. The application focuses on four areas: intelligent customs clearance, visualized collaborative command, convenient clearance systems and comprehensive port campus management. According to a company statement on the Smart Port application, the use of Big Data, AI and cloud computing technology gives the application a unique proposition for operations in busy ports. With this, it is now a matter of ‘when' and not ‘if' the technology will readily find its way to Chinese-backed ports, from Lamu in Kenya to Sines in Portugal. If there is one thing we have learned during the current debate on supply chains, it is their dependence on China. Some commentators see 'decoupling' of these supply chains from China as the best shot at the problem. But is it possible that the discussion is one step behind China's strategy? In a recent article, Andre Wheeler, author of the book China's Belt Road Initiative, sees the next mega-trend being in China's intent to use DSR to cover all BRI participants into a seamless digital platform that integrates all trade. 'One of the key differences between China's DSR and the West is that the DSR is a closed software platform constructed along a single digital spine and skeleton, essentially owned and controlled by the State. This would have key data centrally stored, disseminated and controlled by a state instrument in Beijing, rather than in neutrally accessible data warehouse or cloud-based data storage,' explains Andre. The European Chamber of Commerce in China captured similar sentiments in a 2020 report. It concluded that Chinese-built telecommunications networks and ports are set up in ways that make it hard for European shipping companies and computer software providers hard to compete. The entire value chain of China's shipping sector falls under the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), the owner and regulator of the nation's state-owned enterprises. Thus, the greatest concern is whether the growing dominance of SASAC monopoly - through key investments in 100 ports spread out in 60 nations - will permit a fair global competition with other shipping lines. Further, is it possible SASAC can export some of the China's restrictive cabotage laws to the terminals it operates?  'If China becomes the world's chief network operator, it could reap commercial and strategic windfall. It could reshape global flows of data, finance, and communications to reflect its interests,' predicts Jonathan Hillman. 'It could [also] possess an unrivaled understanding of market movements, the deliberations of foreign competitors, and the lives of countless individuals enmeshed in its networks.'

As part of this strategy, the Chinese government is recommending its tech giants – Huawei, ZTE and Cloudwalk to enter into mobile telephony, social media and e-commerce applications in Africa, according to experts on Sino-African ties. This is part of Digital Silk Road or DSR initiative and is putting in place telecom and digital infrastructure across key African states – Nigeria, Zambia, Angola, Ethiopia and Zimbabwe. As part of the strategy ‘China-Africa Internet Development and Cooperation Forum' was held in August with focus on building digital infrastructure, ET has learnt. A 37,000-km-long and 180 TBPS sub-sea cable named ‘2Africa' connecting Europe and Middle East with 16 African countries has been undertaken by China Mobile International, MTN Global Connect and Vodafone. The 4G infrastructure in Africa has largely been dependent on support provided by Huawei. It is also assisting the African Union in formulating Digital Transformation Strategy with its ‘Agenda-2063'.Simultaneously, Chinese companies are involved in the ‘Smart City' initiative in Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Ghana and Nigeria. China is also reportedly establishing data centres in Kenya, Djibouti, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana and Mali. E-commerce platforms associated with Alibaba are also helping African states to market their agricultural products.'Chinese are the new colonialists in Africa who fulfil a need but like Shylock extract a pound of flesh. This is worsened by the high governance deficit. It is a win-lose situation for the two parties,' according to Pradeep Mehta, Secretary General CUTS International, which has an extensive network in Africa and vast experience in working with locals. Sino-African digital cooperation is also being promoted through international fairs.

Over the last 20 years, Huawei has built about 50% of Africa's 3G networks and 70% of its 4G networks.China is expanding its digital footprints in Africa as a key element of its post Covid economic strategy for the continent and its companies are reported to invest $ 8.43 bn in the continent as part of this grand strategy. As part of this strategy, the Chinese government is recommending its tech giants – Huawei, ZTE and Cloudwalk to enter into mobile telephony, social media and e-commerce applications in Africa, according to experts on Sino-African ties. This is part of Digital Silk Road or DSR initiative and is putting in place telecom and digital infrastructure across key African states – Nigeria, Zambia, Angola, Ethiopia and Zimbabwe. As part of the strategy ‘China-Africa Internet Development and Cooperation Forum' was held in August with focus on building digital infrastructure, ET has learnt. 
A 37,000-km-long and 180 TBPS sub-sea cable named ‘2Africa' connecting Europe and Middle East with 16 African countries has been undertaken by China Mobile International, MTN Global Connect and Vodafone. The 4G infrastructure in Africa has largely been dependent on support provided by Huawei. It is also assisting the African Union in formulating Digital Transformation Strategy with its ‘Agenda-2063'. Simultaneously, Chinese companies are involved in the ‘Smart City' initiative in Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Ghana and Nigeria. China is also reportedly establishing data centres in Kenya, Djibouti, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana and Mali. E-commerce platforms associated with Alibaba are also helping African states to market their agricultural products. 'Chinese are the new colonialists in Africa who fulfil a need but like Shylock extract a pound of flesh. This is worsened by the high governance deficit. It is a win-lose situation for the two parties,' according to Pradeep Mehta, Secretary General CUTS International, which has an extensive network in Africa and vast experience in working with locals. Sino-African digital cooperation is also being promoted through international fairs. To balance Chinese ambitions other stakeholders including India, USA, EU, Japan, Gulf states and Russia may need to expand their presence in Africa's digital sphere.

But in recent years, Beijing has been securing another critical…;China's relations with the Middle East have long revolved around securing the energy it needs to fuel its economic development. But in recent years, Beijing has been securing another critical resource from the region: data.  China's leadership understands that data is the oil that fuels the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the key to achieving technological supremacy, and a source of power in the digital age. China's 2015 Action Plan to Promote the Development of Big Data even designated data 'a fundamental strategic national resource,' calling for the country to 'comprehensively advance the development and application of big data' and 'accelerate the construction of a strong data country.'  Under the umbrella of its Digital Silk Road (DSR), a component of the Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese companies have been rolling out digital infrastructure that facilitates the gathering, transportation, storage, and processing of massive amounts of data from partner countries. Such infrastructure includes e-commerce platforms, mobile payment systems, intelligent data centers, fifth-generation telecommunication networks (5G), undersea cables, satellites, cloud storage, smart cities, and artificial intelligence (AI).  Significant traction Since the DSR was introduced in a white paper jointly issued by China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of Commerce in 2015, the initiative has gained significant traction in the Middle East.  In Saudi Arabia, Huawei is working with the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah to develop digital infrastructure designed to streamline religious pilgrimages, including control rooms in Mecca and Medina reception centers. In Dubai, the company is building a Modular Data Center Complex at its international airport and has teamed up with the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) to support the construction of fiber-optic infrastructure and video surveillance.  Huawei also plans to build the largest solar-powered Uptime Tier III-certified data center in the Middle East and Africa at the United Arab Emirates' Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park and is working with the Abu Dhabi City Municipality (ADM) to construct a Municipal Disaster Recovery Data Center. In Egypt, Huawei opened its first cloud data center in February 2019. Meanwhile, China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) is building an entire city to serve as the country's new administrative capital. The new capital is expected to integrate a range of Chinese smart-city tech.  According to research conducted last year by the RWR Advisory, China has exported smart-city technology to 15 countries in the Middle East. Smart city technology The Israeli cities of Ashdod, Netanya and Rishon Lezion have either established partnerships or are planning to establish partnerships with Chinese tech companies on the smart-city front and 'maintain ‘twin city' links with Xiamen, Wuhan and Tianjin respectively,' according to the Institute for National Security Studies. Israel's Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, and Social Services, and even the police and Israel Defense Forces, have installed camera technologies from the Chinese surveillance company Hikvision.  In Oman, Alibaba has signed an agreement backed by the sultanate's Ministry of Transport, Communications and Information Technology to partner with the corporations Datamount and International Emerging Technology Company to establish a cloud computing center. Local companies will manage the center, but the data will be stored on Alibaba servers. Alibaba has also been expanding its presence significantly in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA) has signed an agreement with Alibaba Cloud to 'empower Saudi cities with intelligence-driven smart city solutions.' On the e-commerce front, both Alibaba and Jollychic have become digital hubs for commerce across the Middle East. Alibaba, in particular, has been expanding its influence by investing in local enterprises. For example, the Chinese tech giant increased its already majority stake in the popular Turkish e-commerce platform Trendyol in 2021 to 85.6%.  Meanwhile, Jollychic's platform has gained prominence in the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Oman, Bahrain and Lebanon, providing services to 50 million users across the region. Of its 1.5 million monthly users in 2018, approximately half were in Saudi Arabia. The company is also active in Jordan thanks to its acquisition of local e-commerce platform MarkaVP for an undisclosed dollar amount in 2017. Jollychic has extended its services by creating a digital payment wallet and plans to expand its ecosystem to include on-demand food delivery, online travel, and transportation booking. In recent years, Chinese mobile payment platforms have also made inroads into the region. In 2018, Israel Credit Card (ICC, CAL) and OneBill partnered with Alibaba to introduce Ali-Pay to the country. This development establishes a foundation for future engagement with Chinese QR code payment methods like WeChat that may be rolled out for the Israeli public in future. In 2019, Jollypay received authorization to be used in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, WeChat-Pay launched in Turkey in July 2020 to facilitate transactions by mainland Chinese tourists across the country.  Data mining Efforts along China's Digital Silk Road are substantially data-driven and data-seeking, centrally focused on the aggregation (and disaggregation) of large data sets feeding into Chinese machine-learning initiatives. Sensors and cameras embedded in smart-city infrastructure transmit reams of data that can be used to understand many dimensions of their host societies. Meanwhile, end-user data from digital payment and e-commerce platforms creates rich maps of consumer behavior that can serve as key economic indicators.  The collection of personal data can train a machine-learning algorithm to improve the quality of service provided to others, including those who have not shared their data. But such processing of data can also raise serious privacy issues.  In nations with Chinese-built infrastructure as well as Chinese digital and telecommunications technologies, a feedback loop can occur: Chinese companies collect sensitive end-user data from applications and structures that can then be processed for use in various sectors, including national security and R&D (research and development) of Chinese products and services. These products and services can be offered back to partner countries in further iterations of BRI and the Digital Silk Road. By harnessing the power of data, China is able to understand facets of the populations and geopolitics of nations better than the governments of those nations themselves.  Middle Eastern countries show less concern regarding data transfer than is seen in other parts of the world. According to a 2021 report by Access Now, a non-profit with a mission to defend and extend the digital civil rights of people around the world, 'across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), data protection legislation is still in its infancy, and it remains a low priority.' As many countries in the region seek to modernize and diversify their economies, officials have welcomed cooperation with their Chinese counterparts in the digital realm. Discussing the arrival of Chinese tech to Saudi Arabia, the country's minister of communications and information technology, Abdullah A Alswaha, remarked, 'We're very proud of our strategic relationship with China … and definitely they're helping us leapfrog to becoming an innovation-based economy.'  The US has not been as enthusiastic as its Middle Eastern partners about these developments. Amid escalating tensions between the world's two largest economies, Washington has told Egyptian, Emirati and Bahraini officials that Huawei 5G is a 'Trojan Horse' and that enlisting the company to build their countries' networks could threaten their ties with the US. Washington has also called for Israel to limit its technology cooperation with China.  However, it seems Washington's efforts have failed to achieve their desired results. Huawei has teamed up with local telecommunication providers in the UAE, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain and Lebanon to construct their 5G networks, while Qatar's leading operator, Ooredoo, has enlisted ZTE to assist with its 5G rollout. Israel will not be enlisting Chinese companies to roll out its 5G network. But it has welcomed Huawei's participation in its solar-panel industry, despite warnings from US officials that 'the data that is collected off of those solar panels could be used to determine other things.'  AI and health Covid-19 has accelerated the need for digital infrastructure and health-care technologies, and much of the region's tech ties with China have deepened. Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI), which specializes in AI, is one company that has made inroads throughout the Middle East. In April 2020, BGI and Israel's AID Genomics received approval from Israeli and Palestinian authorities to establish an emergency Covid-19 testing lab in Gaza. Back in 2019, BGI signed a cooperation agreement with Abu Dhabi's Group 42. A year later, Group 42 announced that it would be establishing an office in Israel.  BGI's expansion in the Middle East has not escaped Washington's scrutiny. American officials have described the company as the 'Huawei of genomics.' According to Bloomberg, the US has raised concerns about the company with its Middle Eastern partners, warning that 'Beijing could glean information of intelligence value and share it with their adversaries like Iran, one of China's top trading partners in the region.'  These concerns are not entirely unfounded. A 2018 study published in the journal Science revealed that with just 2% of the target population's genetic data, researchers were able to identify almost everyone in that population, including those who had never undergone genetic testing. BGI maintains that its customers will manage patient samples and access patient data, not the company. BGI was set to team up with Israel's MyHeritage, a genealogy and health DNA testing company, to build a coronavirus testing lab in Israel, but Israel's Health Ministry shelved the project for reasons undisclosed.  Beijing has dismissed Washington's criticism as a 'purely groundless accusation.' China's Foreign Ministry told Bloomberg that the US is nothing more than 'a thief calling the other a thief,' asserting that 'the US government has long been stealing the private information of its own people and foreigners.'  Against the backdrop of a sweeping crackdown on China's tech industry, Beijing has implemented new data laws to regulate how big tech companies' use people's private information. But these laws do not necessarily prevent the government from acquiring such data. Article 28 of China's Cybersecurity Law remains in effect. The law states that 'network operators shall provide technical support and assistance to public security organs and national security organs that are safeguarding national security.'  As countries in the Middle East become more entangled in China's transnational digital infrastructure network and welcome the many benefits such digital integration affords, they must also confront the challenges. Prioritizing data protection is perhaps a good place to start.  SIGNAL summer associate Sam Pekats contributed to this article.

As the digital assets and cryptocurrencies gain momentum and extensive adoption, many counties are in an intense competition to come with the digital currencies (CBDC). So far, China has been at leading this contest. Many experts consider  China's plan for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) as a highly progressive and civic step that other counties ought to follow. The European Central Bank has already announced its plans to launch a pilot program within two years. Especially, the United States, is worried that digital yuan  will pose a threat threat to the dollar's dominance.
Sinophobia could be defined as anti-Chinese sentiment, and a kind of antagonism against China and Chinese culture. The pandemic has recently triggered a new wave of Sinophobia. Historians state that American Sinophobia date back to to the 1880s when Chinese Exclusion Act was passed. This law banned the Chinese immigrants entering to the US at the time.  Donald Trump's constant accusations against China for Covid-19 worsened the situation in the US.

The concept of  Sinophobia has been more related to trade wars, media, proxy wars and especially economics nowadays. The worsening political, economic, and social relationship between the US and China have been at at the forefront of the media . A recently published report from the Pew Research Center reveals that, 73 percent of Americans has an unfavourable view of China. This ratio was 47 percent in 2018. This therefore means that Sinophobia exists on both governmental and public level. China's digital yuan seems to be the most prominent reason behind Sinophobia currently. So, thi digital asset is a threat to the West or a progressive move in the transformation of traditional fiat money?

While People's Bank of China has stated that the alleged objective of minting a digital yuan is to lessen transaction costs and bring efficiency into  the payments, the West claims that the real intent of introducing a digital yuan is to intensify state authority of the payments system and to monitor transactions and even personal behavior. Chinese yuan (e-CNY), which is known as the digital currency and electronic payment (DCEP) system has been under test for a while. Wide Pilot programs have been set up in big cities; and, in June,  a lottery was held in June to  pay out RMB 40 million ($6.2 million) in digital cash. Residents of the city joined the lottery by employing two banking apps for the opportunity to win one of the 200,000 digital yuan 'red packets,' each worth about $31, which could be utilized for shopping at certain business points.
Whereas Chinese government is proud that it is moving towards a cashless society. Some economist think otherwise. Cornell economist Eswar Prasad's new book titled as The Future of Money: How the Digital Revolution Is Transforming Currencies and Finance makes a warning about the role of central bank digital currencies in non-democratic societies. The book informs that 'In authoritarian societies, central bank money in digital form could become an additional instrument of government control over citizens rather than just a convenient, safe, and stable medium of exchange.'
The US also is concerned about the digital colonialism and it has some solid reasons. Launched in 2015, the Digital Silk Road (DSR) is a part of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The project urges Chinese companies s to spread the construction of digital infrastructure and integrate communications technology (ICT) markets in countries that take part in the BRI. The US regards this project as a sinister way to force the adoption of digital yuan, thus increasing the Chinese control in the Western financial system. The US government has recently asked the EU counties to abandon the project. The outstanding Chinese company Huawei is also under pressure. In spite of the increased regulatory scrutiny from the EU and US, Huawei made 90 agreement in the first two months of the year and almost 50 of these were signed with European companies.
Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer at the Human Rights Foundation, has revealed the dangers of central bank digital currency  to financial freedom and privacy especially in authoritarian regimes like China. Digital yuan is designed for domestic use, not cross-border transactions, at least initially.  The Western axis claim that the dollar has this unique status as a safe-haven currency  as it is supported by U.S. institutions that preserve basic freedoms and human rights. Powel has recently said that a digital dollar will be useful for the world economy.
It is clear that digital yuan will pose a risk dollar dominance in the long term. As China and Eurasian countries get more politically and financially powerful, China will do its best to expand its digital yuan in Africa, Middle East, Asia and elsewhere. Some experts believe that digital yuan is a perfect achievement which indicates the power and superiority of China in financial technology while US government considers digital yuan as a secret weapon.  One thing we are sure is that China has been rehearsing to overtake the US.

Second in a series produced by Forkast.News with support from the Judith Neilson Institute's Asian Stories project. Read part I here.When the first caravans carrying Chinese silks arrived in ancient Rome, it set off a female fashion craze. The wives of senators and generals had never felt or seen anything so lustrous. Like the Chinese elite, they adopted the material as a symbol of wealth and status, embroidered silk robes with gold and wore them to the grave. China announced a Digital Silk Road (DSR) in 2015 with a white paper that described a range of technology and communications projects. But it wasn't obvious what, if anything, would play the role of silk. Now it's clear that just as threads spun from the pupae of silkworms drove the growth of a global trade network, China's digital yuan may weave an international system of finance. The first inroads have already been dug: Developing economies have adopted the yuan as their own, and wealthier economies in Asia and beyond are exploring their own fiat digital currency, whether they like it or not, to stay competitive with China.'[Government leaders] are looking for the light at the end of the tunnel and the train is the light; it's coming right at them,' said Don Tapscott, executive chairman of the Toronto-based Blockchain Research Institute. The stakes are high, with implications for everything from financial privacy to the global balance of power. 'If China wins with its central bank digital currency, they'll roll it out across … Africa, into Southeast Asia,' he said. 'The [yuan] becomes the currency of record and that's the end of the American hegemony in the world.'The DSR is an essential component of China's global infrastructure plan, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), announced in 2013. A project of staggering scope — though without much transparency — the BRI is China's estimated trillion-dollar down payment in development and investment initiatives that span the transcontinental routes of the original silk road from Asia to Europe and the maritime shipping lanes that displaced them in the late 18th-century. By China's count, 140 countries have signed on.From a project management perspective, the BRI and DSR have one major headache in common: contending with outdated and often ineffectual banking systems. Beijing sees the digital yuan as a solution to this problem as well as a way to mutually reinforce the reach of both projects, said Stanley Chao, president of a Los Angeles-based firm that consults on Asian business strategies.'In emerging markets with poor banking systems, it can take a week to clear transactions, slowing everything down and causing delays,' he said. 'China sees a digital currency as a solution. Payments will be instantaneous. Transaction fees will be almost down to zero because you have no middle man.' 'At some point, I could see China making trade pacts where it said, ‘Let's do one currency. We'll save a lot of money on transaction fees, no third-party banking system,'' said Chao. 'There are countries, not only in Asia, but in Africa, Eastern Europe and South America, that might jump at the idea.'The conjecture is already a reality. In December 2019, to facilitate a US$54 billion project known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, Pakistan announced the yuan as its new second national currency—a role long occupied by the dollar. Six months later, Turkey Telekom agreed to use yuan for import payments. In China's view, the digital yuan would fuel a virtuous cycle: The more countries see the benefits of settling accounts in yuan, the greater the network effect in further expanding the orbit of Chinese economic influence. Between 2000 and 2015, China's trade settlement in yuan increased from roughly zero to US$1.1 trillion, according to the National Bureau of Asian Research, close to a third of the country's total trade. But even by 2021, only 2.5% of international payments worldwide were transacted in yuan, according to the CSIS China Project, compared to 39% in the U.S. dollar and 36% in the euro. That leaves the yuan with considerable room to grow.For many countries, developing their own fiat digital currency is more appealing than adopting China's. According to a January 2021 survey by the Bank of International Settlements — the central bank of central banks — 86% of its 65 members are exploring the idea; 60% have begun experiments; and 14% have pilots underway. This interest is shared among economies of every size and state of development. In October 2020, the Bahamas announced the arrival of the 'sand dollar,' a CBDC pegged to the U.S. dollar. That same month Cambodia launched the digital bakong, describing it as a 'hybrid CBDC' that supports transactions in both the Cambodian riel and U.S. dollar. Indonesia's central bank governor confirmed in May that Southeast Asia's largest economy would launch a digital currency. And South Korea is preparing its CBDC for a pilot test in August. Meanwhile, Singapore recently completed a five-year experiment in blockchain-based financial architecture. One of the prongs involved a cross-border payment model developed with U.S. banking giant JPMorgan and Singapore global investment firm Temasek. 'China's CBDC was really creating some peer pressure here in the region,' said Charles d'Haussy, Asia managing director of Consensys, a blockchain software firm that is working on CBDC projects for the central banks of Australia and Hong Kong. 'It's a big shift in the industry [that] shows there is institutional and regulatory adoption.'Even as they move forward, however, some central banks have expressed reluctance, aware that they are being forced to chase China's lead. In a March 2021 speech at an annual tech summit co-hosted by the Nikkei, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda described the digital yen as an obligation more than a choice. 'Central banks share the view that it is not an appropriate policy response to start considering CBDC only when the need to issue CBDC arises in the future,' said Kuroda. He also reiterated that the bank had no plans to issue a digital yen.If Japan feels that it is being dragged into the digital age of money, it is not alone. Ten years ago, India was considered an economic and political competitor to China. But even with an economy expected to be the world's third-largest by 2030, India has failed to keep technological pace with its regional rival. Despite having world-class technology universities and a large pool of elite programmers, India has generally followed China's hostility to private cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but without also adopting its embrace of blockchain as an infrastructure of the future. India nonetheless recognizes the network effect in play and has recently — and ambivalently — stepped into the brave new world of government-backed digital currency. In the span of a single week this past February, the Reserve Bank of India released a report stating that CBDC 'poses a risk of disintermediation of the banking system,' followed a few days later by the bank's governor publicly acknowledging the digital rupee is 'receiving our full attention.' 'Now that China and other nations are talking about central bank digital currency, India is also definitely motivated,' said Nischal Shetty, founder and CEO of WazirX, one of India's largest cryptocurrency exchanges. He speaks widely on related regulatory issues. (In June, Indian authorities notified Shetty that it was investigating the use of WazirX for money laundering.) He said the competition between India and China in CBDC is healthy. 'I want more countries around the world to experiment with [CBDCs] so that every other nation is motivated to participate,' he said. Shetty predicts India will have made substantial progress in a CBDC within two years.The rapid move by central banks toward the development of CBDCs raises the question: How will the digitization of cross-border transactions and settlements impact the role of SWIFT, the dominant global network for interbank transaction communications that has been at the center of global currency flows since 1973?This past February, four central banks took a first step toward deploying their digital currency in cross-border trade without using the SWIFT system as an intermediary. They announced a pilot project, called m-CBDC, or multiple CBDC, that amounts to a transactions bridge among the central banks of China, Hong Kong, Thailand and the UAE. The trial — intended to identify technical and regulatory pain points in commercial digital currency transactions — is being closely watched by governments everywhere. 'This is the first time you are seeing four different central banks working on building a shared infrastructure to go cross-border,' said d'Haussy. 'It's probably the most ambitious proof-of-concept in terms of digital currencies in 2021, after China's retail digital yuan.' Three months after the m-CBDC announcement, SWIFT released a joint discussion paper with consulting firm Accenture on how it could accommodate cross-border CBDC payments and, the subtext suggested, remain relevant. Touting that it is 'neutral and currency agnostic,' SWIFT contended that 'there is little advantage in reinventing the wheel.'If anything, reinventing the wheel appears very much to be the point. 'Using a new type of money in old pipes will probably not bring all the value proposition of digital assets,' said d'Haussy. 'When you reinvent money, it's a good opportunity to rethink the world ecosystem.'As it happens, this is exactly what concerns the United States, the country with the most to lose from a diminution of SWIFT's role in the global financial order. Part Three will examine how power and privacy may change with the new money.";coindesk.com;1153;business;US;en;['https://www.coindesk.com/author/forkast-news'];https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/kayla-kozlowski-ECQ-3QXThAA-unsplash-1200x628.jpg;False;@coindesk;31.789051;1e9839cc418f499dec32c13f81f7c4b7;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND DSR', 'lang': 'en', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'from': '3 years ago', 'sort_by': 'date', 'page': 1}

'[Government leaders] are looking for the light at the end of the tunnel and the train is the light; it's coming right at them,' said Don Tapscott, executive chairman of the Toronto-based Blockchain Research Institute. The stakes are high, with implications for everything from financial privacy to the global balance of power. 'If China wins with its central bank digital currency, they'll roll it out across … Africa, into Southeast Asia,' he said. 'The [yuan] becomes the currency of record and that's the end of the American hegemony in the world.'

Faster, cheaper money

The DSR is an essential component of China's global infrastructure plan, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), announced in 2013. A project of staggering scope — though without much transparency — the BRI is China's estimated trillion-dollar down payment in development and investment initiatives that span the transcontinental routes of the original silk road from Asia to Europe and the maritime shipping lanes that displaced them in the late 18th-century. By China's count, 140 countries have signed on.

Story continues

From a project management perspective, the BRI and DSR have one major headache in common: contending with outdated and often ineffectual banking systems. Beijing sees the digital yuan as a solution to this problem as well as a way to mutually reinforce the reach of both projects, said Stanley Chao, president of a Los Angeles-based firm that consults on Asian business strategies.

'In emerging markets with poor banking systems, it can take a week to clear transactions, slowing everything down and causing delays,' he said. 'China sees a digital currency as a solution. Payments will be instantaneous. Transaction fees will be almost down to zero because you have no middle man.'

'At some point, I could see China making trade pacts where it said, ‘Let's do one currency. We'll save a lot of money on transaction fees, no third-party banking system,'' said Chao. 'There are countries, not only in Asia, but in Africa, Eastern Europe and South America, that might jump at the idea.'

The conjecture is already a reality. In December 2019, to facilitate a US$54 billion project known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, Pakistan announced the yuan as its new second national currency—a role long occupied by the dollar. Six months later, Turkey Telekom agreed to use yuan for import payments.

In China's view, the digital yuan would fuel a virtuous cycle: The more countries see the benefits of settling accounts in yuan, the greater the network effect in further expanding the orbit of Chinese economic influence.

Between 2000 and 2015, China's trade settlement in yuan increased from roughly zero to US$1.1 trillion, according to the National Bureau of Asian Research, close to a third of the country's total trade. But even by 2021, only 2.5% of international payments worldwide were transacted in yuan, according to the CSIS China Project, compared to 39% in the U.S. dollar and 36% in the euro. That leaves the yuan with considerable room to grow.

Peer pressure

For many countries, developing their own fiat digital currency is more appealing than adopting China's. According to a January 2021 survey by the Bank of International Settlements — the central bank of central banks — 86% of its 65 members are exploring the idea; 60% have begun experiments; and 14% have pilots underway.

This interest is shared among economies of every size and state of development. In October 2020, the Bahamas announced the arrival of the 'sand dollar,' a CBDC pegged to the U.S. dollar. That same month Cambodia launched the digital bakong, describing it as a 'hybrid CBDC' that supports transactions in both the Cambodian riel and U.S. dollar. Indonesia's central bank governor confirmed in May that Southeast Asia's largest economy would launch a digital currency. And South Korea is preparing its CBDC for a pilot test in August. Meanwhile, Singapore recently completed a five-year experiment in blockchain-based financial architecture. One of the prongs involved a cross-border payment model developed with U.S. banking giant JPMorgan and Singapore global investment firm Temasek.

'China's CBDC was really creating some peer pressure here in the region,' said Charles d'Haussy, Asia managing director of Consensys, a blockchain software firm that is working on CBDC projects for the central banks of Australia and Hong Kong. 'It's a big shift in the industry [that] shows there is institutional and regulatory adoption.'

Even as they move forward, however, some central banks have expressed reluctance, aware that they are being forced to chase China's lead.

In a March 2021 speech at an annual tech summit co-hosted by the Nikkei, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda described the digital yen as an obligation more than a choice. 'Central banks share the view that it is not an appropriate policy response to start considering CBDC only when the need to issue CBDC arises in the future,' said Kuroda. He also reiterated that the bank had no plans to issue a digital yen.

If Japan feels that it is being dragged into the digital age of money, it is not alone. Ten years ago, India was considered an economic and political competitor to China. But even with an economy expected to be the world's third-largest by 2030, India has failed to keep technological pace with its regional rival.

Despite having world-class technology universities and a large pool of elite programmers, India has generally followed China's hostility to private cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but without also adopting its embrace of blockchain as an infrastructure of the future. India nonetheless recognizes the network effect in play and has recently — and ambivalently — stepped into the brave new world of government-backed digital currency.

In the span of a single week this past February, the Reserve Bank of India released a report stating that CBDC 'poses a risk of disintermediation of the banking system,' followed a few days later by the bank's governor publicly acknowledging the digital rupee is 'receiving our full attention.'

'Now that China and other nations are talking about central bank digital currency, India is also definitely motivated,' said Nischal Shetty, founder and CEO of WazirX, one of India's largest cryptocurrency exchanges. He speaks widely on related regulatory issues. (In June, Indian authorities notified Shetty that it was investigating the use of WazirX for money laundering.) He said the competition between India and China in CBDC is healthy. 'I want more countries around the world to experiment with [CBDCs] so that every other nation is motivated to participate,' he said. Shetty predicts India will have made substantial progress in a CBDC within two years.

The rapid move by central banks toward the development of CBDCs raises the question: How will the digitization of cross-border transactions and settlements impact the role of SWIFT, the dominant global network for interbank transaction communications that has been at the center of global currency flows since 1973?

This past February, four central banks took a first step toward deploying their digital currency in cross-border trade without using the SWIFT system as an intermediary. They announced a pilot project, called m-CBDC, or multiple CBDC, that amounts to a transactions bridge among the central banks of China, Hong Kong, Thailand and the UAE. The trial — intended to identify technical and regulatory pain points in commercial digital currency transactions — is being closely watched by governments everywhere.

'This is the first time you are seeing four different central banks working on building a shared infrastructure to go cross-border,' said d'Haussy. 'It's probably the most ambitious proof-of-concept in terms of digital currencies in 2021, after China's retail digital yuan.'

Three months after the m-CBDC announcement, SWIFT released a joint discussion paper with consulting firm Accenture on how it could accommodate cross-border CBDC payments and, the subtext suggested, remain relevant. Touting that it is 'neutral and currency agnostic,' SWIFT contended that 'there is little advantage in reinventing the wheel.'

If anything, reinventing the wheel appears very much to be the point. 'Using a new type of money in old pipes will probably not bring all the value proposition of digital assets,' said d'Haussy. 'When you reinvent money, it's a good opportunity to rethink the world ecosystem.'

As it happens, this is exactly what concerns the United States, the country with the most to lose from a diminution of SWIFT's role in the global financial order. Part Three will examine how power and privacy may change with the new money.

How? By working closely with China where strategic objectives align, such as climate change, economic development, cyber innovation, supply chain resilience, and even counterterrorism.This year's Group of Seven (G7) summit came at a global, economic, and geopolitical juncture. The world is grappling with a plethora of issues that call for robust multilateral coordination and swift action. Strategic timing is further amplified by the fact that the G7 marks Joe Biden's first stop on his inaugural foreign trip as president, preceding meetings with NATO, top EU leadership, and, most prominently, a one-on-one summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva.Equitable vaccine distribution, the post-pandemic global economic recovery, an accelerating climate crisis, reinvigorated diplomacy in the Middle East, and intensified geopolitical competition between the West and China are just a few of the issues that animated discussions as world leaders converged on the English coastline in Cornwall. The summit's final communique specifically mentions China and that the G7 would continue to consider how best to challenge China's behavior in the global economy. Beijing took little time in decisively responding: 'The days when global decisions were dictated by a small group of countries are long gone,' a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the UK said.It is hardly a coincidence that the UK invited the leaders of Australia, Japan, and South Korea – Asian partners critical to counterbalancing Beijing – to the summit. The China question is particularly relevant to Middle Eastern states who perform a delicate balancing act between benefiting from a Western security apparatus and Beijing's economic promise.For the latest headlines, follow our Google News channel online or via the app.China is a global powerhouse. It was the only major economy not to contract in 2020, exporting over $268 billion in goods last November alone. Confrontational rivalry may become a reality if Chinese conduct induces it, but it is not something the West should embrace lightly without understanding the costs. Instead of seeking to counter China, the G7 should look to constructively engage with Beijing where interests align. In doing so, the West would enable Middle Eastern states to transcend their increasingly untenable dichotomy of Western military support and Chinese foreign investment. Unrestrained rivalry leads to security dilemmas that distort the behavior of states trapped within them – a reality the MENA region can't afford. The depth and breadth of Chinese economic influence in the region makes the balancing act particularly challenging.Beijing's relationship with the Middle East is driven by energy security and its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a global infrastructure development strategy begun in 2013 with the aim of placing China at the heart of global trade networks. The BRI connects Asia with Africa and Europe, but more importantly improves regional integration, stimulates economic growth, and increases cross-regional trade. This entails sustained Chinese investments across multiple strategic sectors in the Gulf, such as logistics infrastructure in key ports, e.g., Khalifa in the UAE, Duqm in Oman, and Jazan in Saudi Arabia.As GCC states navigate an awkward balance between Beijing and the West, they may be forced to take industry-specific sides. For instance, the Chinese government launched a digital sub-strand of the BRI called the Digital Silk Road (DSR) to promote innovation-driven development and intensify transnational cooperation in artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and quantum computing.Like the BRI, the DSR leverages the strengths of Chinese public and private sector conglomerates to further integrate Chinese technologies and standards into the digital ecosystems of frontier and emerging economies. This begets the possibility of further bifurcation between the West and China in global telecommunications infrastructure and digital technologies – areas with inexorable security and defense implications for host nations, as highlighted by the West's recent effort to boycott Chinese tech giant Huawei.Rather than exploring ways in which they can work with China on major global challenges, the Cornwall summit saw the G7 launch an independent infrastructure investment initiative dubbed Build Back Better World (B3W), an explicit, more environmentally focused retort to the BRI. While onlookers may interpret this as simply healthy competition, others will recognize obvious realpolitik suggesting a zero-sum equation with regards to infrastructure investment as a means of influence. This will come at the expense of socio-economic development progress in the Middle East where oil-reliant states may be forced to choose between rival initiatives. Alternatively, alignment and strategic synergy between both initiatives would maximize regional socio-economic growth potential, diversification efforts, and inclusive development.Beyond infrastructure investment, the G7 and Beijing can find immediate common ground in combatting COVID-19. IMF estimates suggest that inoculating 70 percent of the world's population by April 2022 would cost a mere $50 billion, just 0.13 percent of the G7's GDP. In terms of increased global output, the cumulative economic benefit by 2025 would be $9 trillion, to say nothing of the many lives that would be saved.COVAX, a multilateral initiative backed by the World Health Organization to provide vaccines to ill-supplied countries, is itself ill-supplied today. The Cornwall summit saw leaders of the G7 pledge one billion COVID-19 vaccine doses to low-income countries as a 'big step towards vaccinating the world,' but most recent distribution trends indicate massive unmet potential. The Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that, if current distribution trends persist, substantive vaccine coverage in more than 85 low-income countries may not be possible until 2023. Preventing this dreary reality hinges on strategic cooperation with Beijing. For nations like Lebanon, Sudan, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen, vaccine-centric coordination between G7 nations and China is quite literally a matter of life and death.Leaders of the G7 also reaffirmed a commitment to stop the Islamic Republic of Iran from building nuclear weapons. While there are signs that talks in Vienna involving the US, E3, China, Russia, and Iran are making progress, closer cooperation between Beijing and the G7 has the potential to stimulate broader thinking about stability in the Arabian Gulf through inclusive diplomatic dialogue.Such cooperation would significantly improve the chance of negotiating an effective nuclear deal with material ramifications for Iran's ballistic missile program and militant proxy network. Sino-Western efforts have the potential to extend across peacemaking and diplomatic initiatives – supporting fickle political progress in Sudan and Libya can be first on the agenda.Rather than haggling over a hodgepodge of statements or anodyne communiques, G7 nations should aim for practical cooperation and strategic intersections that maximize transnational socio-economic development. At a moment when the pandemic and questions about the future of the Western liberal model are at the forefront of leaders' minds, the Middle East's path to prosperity should not be put on the back burner.History suggests that pragmatic cooperation between China and the G7 is possible, with central bank coordination, climate change, P5+1 negotiations, and foreign aid as just a few examples. The G7's claim of being a significant international force still rests on its ability to address cross-regional stability and economic development. Attempting to detach such global priorities from the byproducts of great power competition is, at best, untenable, and at worst, destabilizing.Read more:G7 global tax plan won't ‘break the camel's back' in GCC states: ExpertsChina denounces G7 statement, urges group to stop slandering countryG7 demand action from Russia on cyberattacks, use of chemical weapons Disclaimer: Views expressed by writers in this section are their own and do not reflect Al Arabiya English's point-of-view.;alarabiya.net;2704;news;AE;en;[];https://vid.alarabiya.net/images/2021/06/11/afada632-9317-4469-8e64-96527056594b/afada632-9317-4469-8e64-96527056594b_16x9_600x338.jpg;False;@AlArabiya_Eng;22.308802;a86d55c27154c41f9b439207114131fb;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND DSR', 'lang': 'en', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'from': '3 years ago', 'sort_by': 'date', 'page': 1}

Those who hesitate to jump on Beijing's hi-tech bandwagon or even throw sand in its gears may soon regret it, says Beijing-based author Thomas Weir Pauken II.China has doubled down on implementing its Digital Silk Road (DSR) project with special focus on the technological development of the world's emerging economies and provision of cutting edge digital services. The DSR's backbone is a network of 15,000 km-long (9,300 mile) subsea cables designed to bring Asia, Africa, and Europe together.
However, the Biden administration appears to want to keep Donald Trump's pressure on China's hi-tech sector. Earlier this month, Washington added three companies and four branches of China's National Supercomputing Centre to its black list. In March, the White House further restricted companies from supplying items to China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.
""The battle between US and China hi-tech firms – was, is and will be – fierce,"" says Thomas Weir Pauken II, a Beijing-based Asia-Pacific Affairs commentator and author of US vs. China: From Trade War to Reciprocal Deal. ""Right now, California's Silicon Valley companies are major donors to the Democrat Party and Biden's campaign treasury, so this explains why Biden continues to act like Trump and Pompeo by taking a tough stand against Beijing.""
According to Pauken, Washington has weaponised ""human rights"" to impose economic sanctions on China's hi-tech companies in a bid to upend the industry's rise.
""The foreign governments banning a number of Chinese tech firms connected to Xinjiang issues was a simple case of stopping a business rival while using diversionary tactics to fool the public,"" he says.
On 20 April, American economist Jeffrey D. Sachs and Canadian human rights lawyer William Schabas recently argued that ""the US government needlessly escalated its rhetoric against China,"" especially criticising the Biden administration for accusing Beijing of ""genocide"" of the Uighur people.

US Big Tech Monopoly is Facing Decline
Washington's unfair competition practices should be seen in the context of the American hi-tech industry's slow but imminent decline, Pauken believes: ""The US hi-tech sector reached its peak when Apple's former CEO Steve Jobs was alive, but ever since his death US hi-tech firms lost their cutting edge and zest for pursuing innovations.""
Currently, Big Tech appears to be more interested in accumulating wealth, becoming influential in politics, and promoting ""woke values,"" than in creating amazing companies that will continue to dominate in their specific tech sectors, according to the Beijing-based commentator.
For their part, China's hi-tech pioneers and companies stand eager to surpass their American rivals, he notes. To that end, the Chinese government has set up what's commonly known as ""Public-Private-Partnerships (PPP)"" which brings together officials, academia, grassroots citizens, investors, and private enterprises in order to promote an ""innovation culture"" and boost the domestic science and hi-tech sectors.
""It's a winning strategy because government can provide subsidies and support to encourage scientists and developers to focus on what they are best at, which is being scientists and investors,"" Pauken says.
China's major universities have established research and development (R&D) hubs so that professors, students, companies, scientists, and inventors can be provided with sufficient funding and be surrounded by necessary testing equipment and space to brainstorm and create new technologies, the author elaborates. After the development phase these hubs host special seminars inviting fintech investors, companies and government officials to introduce new ideas and gadgets to the marketplace.
""Shenzhen is China's Silicon Valley and Beijing has launched the ‘Greater Bay Region' to accelerate PPPs,"" Pauken explains. ""Additionally, the rise of China and other countries' hi-tech sectors will be good for global consumers. In recent years, US hi-tech firms were acting like bully monopolists and if they get dethroned many countries will benefit from America's hi-tech downfall.""

DSR: Emerging Markets Will be the Biggest Winners
Washington and London are shooting themselves in the foot by blocking Chinese companies from supporting 5G networks and by fuelling a negative narrative about Beijing's DSR, argues the author.
""By enforcing decoupling that will mean US and UK companies will fall behind in the global race for 6G,"" Pauken argues.
Similarly, China will surge ahead with its DSR even if the US and UK refuse to join in, he stresses.
""Truth be told, Beijing has long known Washington and London would oppose China's DSR and as such they just don't care about that issue anymore,"" he says. ""They will focus their attention on China's economy, the EU and the emerging markets in efforts to expand the DSR footprint.""
Emerging markets are set to become the biggest beneficiaries of China's DSR, according to the Beijing-based commentator. In addition to this, China's new digital currency will allow foreign enterprises from Southeast Asia (ASEAN), the Middle East, and Africa to speed up their financial transactions, trade operations, and investment activities, he adds. They will be able to make foreign currency exchanges via their mobile devices and store Big Data and all their financial transactions with digital record-keeping.
""Developing nations require deeper support in technology partnerships to move forward on nationwide industrialisation, urbanisation and modernisation drives,"" Pauken notes. ""The DSR will make it much cheaper and convenient to enhance cross-border trade and investments… For DSR to succeed from a tech standpoint that requires full development of 5G telecom networks to boost Wifi speeds and memory storage, which can pave the path for tremendous advancements in AI, robotics, internet of things (IoT), blockchain, serverless computing and so much more.""";Sputnik News - World News, Breaking News & Top Stories;1079;news;RU;en;[];https://cdn1.img.sputniknews.com/images/107954/04/1079540434.jpg;False;;36.840843;82f8bd05fb206fecd82023ab702f0b7e;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND DSR', 'lang': 'en', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'from': '3 years ago', 'sort_by': 'date', 'page': 1}

In the recent years, China has gained the attention in the international community as a country that is focusing on the goal of global connectivity under Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
The smooth development and progress of projects under BRI has offered a good example of solving global problems of physical infrastructure today faced by individual countries and regions at large.
BRI has widely opened the doors of bilateral and multilateral cooperation on regional and international level that also brought the opportunities of working jointly on digitalization of the global society.
The idea of BRI attracted numerous countries and international organizations that were looking forward for the bulk of investment in infrastructural development, gas and oil pipelines, energy projects and others.
In the same way, under the umbrella of BRI, the vision of Digital Silk Road (DSR) announced in 2015 have performed till now as a long term vision of building a new model of cooperation that is providing the facilitation and innovations mostly for developing countries who face the lack of technological development .
The consistent focus of Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) on Global Governance and BRI proved as a great support in building a unanimous approach to inject new impetus in unimpeded supply chains, digital trade and essential public goods for Asian economies and beyond.
The concept of digital trade under DSR have been developing a new blueprint for expansion of trade digitally among Asian economies and BRI countries with the up-gradation of digital gateways amid the pandemic. 
DSR has accelerated the development of future-oriented and high-standard economic integration leading towards multilateral trading system digitally in the post pandemic era.
Digital communication has been recognized as an important basis for quickly giving all nations access to smart technologies and strategies that are helping to promote regional cooperation by injecting new impetus into regional economic growth.
In the face of COVID-19 pandemic, digital collaboration is leading towards the scaling up E-Commerce activities that has turned into a positive development for economic growth.
The timely transferring the knowledge of technology from China towards partner countries accelerated process of innovation and development of digital technologies that is continuously ensuring the regional and global supply chains to promote green investment, digital transition and facilitation of cross-border infrastructure.
It is far sure that the concept of DSR is helping to attain sustainable economic recovery that is also fulfilling the gap of physical connectivity during the current health crisis globally.
DSR has brought not only benefits for China to export Chinese products to global markets but it is also helping partner countries to export their products to China and to raise the volume of trade.
By taking the advantages of DSR, cross border E- Commerce has witnessed the rapid boom and the forces of unilateralism and protectionism have been left far behind.
Purchase and sale of Products and goods between China and the partner countries have given birth to new technological firms and strengthened those working already in the technological sector.
The development of DSR have pushed a boom for digital trade connections between China and others and the digital trade activities injected vigorous vitality against backdrop of COVID-19 and anti-globalization drive.
The active promotion of network infrastructure and digital transformation is boosting the economic value that attached the great importance to the economic zones between China and Asian countries including BRI partners.
The achievements of China in the fields of Cloud Computing, Big Data, 5G, Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT) have been seen by the global community as an opportunity of more collaboration that can accelerate the process of digital economic transformation more smoothly.
The fast scale development of internet in China has laid the foundation of digital cooperation in this new era of technological advancement for all at equal basis.
The sudden global outbreak of COVID-19 resulting the economic uncertainty pushed forward BRI partner countries in adoption of DSR for upgrading their internet infrastructure to spur the growth of online consumption.
The joining of BRI countries for ongoing stream of innovations in China enhanced their digitization process with the benefits of high quality progress.
The rapid and effective development of BRI with the connectivity at its core, China as a major country is fulfilling its global responsibility to share the dividends of its achievements in various sectors including the technology.
The fragmented markets of developed countries were already in a dire need to develop digital gateways for enhancing the movement of their goods domestically and internationally in a smooth manner during the pandemic.
The broadened infrastructure of E-Commerce in China is injecting the new momentum of freight trade for BRI partner countries locally and globally that is ensuring the timely movements of goods across the globe.
The DSR has been continuously promoting the connectivity between consumers and local businesses in China and BRI countries through financial technology, education technology, E-Commerce softwares and smartphones.
It is being observed that DSR has enabled the BRI partner countries to enjoy the advanced IT infrastructure such as fiber optic, E- Commerce and broadband that have highlighted the needs of communication infrastructure for sustainable digital system.
The sharing of Chinese technological development as part of DRS has emerged as a tool kit in providing favorable environment for the sake of controlling the pandemic and public welfare.

The event will be a platform for facilitating cooperation for e-governance and the digital economy, and advance the development of China's Digital Silk Road (DSR) initiative.
DSR was launched in 2015 by Beijing as part of its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Within this strategy, China is providing development and financial aid to participating states along the New Silk Road. When it comes to DSR, this assistance includes upgrading recipients' telecom networks, developing e-commerce and mobile payment systems, as well as artificial intelligence, surveillance, smart cities, cloud computing, and other cutting edge technologies. ​One of DSR's elements is BeiDou, China's global satellite navigation system – a worthy rival of the US' GPS – which has already been adopted by a number of countries in Asia, Middle East, and Africa. According to some estimates, one-third of the countries participating in BRI (approximately 138) are currently cooperating within the framework of DSR initiatives.

​The DSR's backbone is made up of the Pakistan and East Africa Connecting Europe (PEACE) 15,000 km-long (9,300 mile) subsea cables meant to tie Asia, Africa, and Europe together. The network, which is designed to transmit over 16Tbps per fibre pair, is owned by Hengtong Group, a China-headquartered international optical fibre and power cable manufacturer.

The Mediterranean section of the cable going from Egypt to France has already been laid. In March 2021, the Special Communications Organisation (SCO), the telecommunications branch of the Pakistan Army, was set to start laying the final stretch of a cross-border fibre optic cable between Rawalpindi and the port cities of Karachi and Gwadar in partnership with China's Huawei Technologies, according to Nikkei. The PEACE cable is expected to become operational later this year.
DSR Catalyses a More Digitalised World
Meanwhile, American influential think tanks warn that China's initiative poses a challenge to the established dominance of Western digital companies and could substantially diminish their market share in the future.
""The Digital Silk Road advances China's bid for technological independence at home while moving it toward the centre of global networks,"" noted the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in February 2021.


""Digital infrastructure is becoming even more essential to modern economies with the arrival of faster networks, cheaper sensors, and the proliferation of connected devices.""Read @HillmanJE's commentary on competing with China's Digital Silk Road: https://t.co/a8V9JwVqL0

​According to the think tank, China has become increasingly competitive in delivering advanced telecom and subsea cable systems. Besides this, the DRS initiative is ""well-timed, dovetailing with powerful, longer-running trends,"" CSIS admitted, stressing that the COVID pandemic made digital infrastructure ""even more essential."" The think tank argued that the Biden administration should step up the US technological development to tackle China's challenge.
The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), a US influential nonprofit think tank shares CSIS' concerns, suggesting that China could resort to espionage and coercion therefore misusing its telecom dominance. Beijing may train interested DSR on how to use surveillance capabilities against opposition groups and how to monitor and censor the internet in real time, according to the think tank. China's digital independence bid might play into the hands of global customers, suggest Richard Ghiasy and Rajeshwari Krishnamurthy in their op-ed for The Diplomat, a Washington DC-based magazine specialising in Indo-Pacific affairs.
""A small number of actors lead the tech world, and US tech giants Alphabet (Google), Intel, Amazon, Cisco, and Facebook in particular have a near-global monopoly in their respective domains,"" the researchers highlight.
By the end of 2018, American Big Tech owned or leased over half of the undersea cable bandwidth which carried close to 98 percent of international internet data and telephone traffic. ""Such dominance is not healthy and several actors, including the EU and Australia, have taken steps to curb these tech giants' sway,"" the researchers pointed out, adding that China, for its part, may provide competitively priced digital products and services.
While theoretically China could gain a ""valuable tool of local political influence"" by manipulating other countries' reliance on its infrastructure, this hypothetical scenario, however, ""is not exclusive to China,"" the authors believe. ""As the Edward Snowden revelations and the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal showed, any tech provider or cyber tech-advanced actor could abuse their position, if so desired,"" Ghiasy and Krishnamurthy remark.
The DSR catalyses a ""more digitalised world"" which might offer spinoff investment and sales opportunities not only for Chinese tech-firms but also to local companies and non-tech sectors, according to the researchers. At the same time, the Beijing endeavour obviously challenges the US dominance in the digital sphere and global market.
""Regardless of where one stands, amidst a pandemic that has wreaked havoc on the global economy, digitalisation and economic growth are as welcome as ever,"" the authors conclude.";Sputnik News - World News, Breaking News & Top Stories;1079;news;RU;en;[];https://cdn1.img.sputniknews.com/images/07e4/0c/03/1081344880.jpg;False;;41.179974;0aaad30471a732327c4a48b3f3a3f24e;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND DSR', 'lang': 'en', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'from': '3 years ago', 'sort_by': 'date', 'page': 1}

What will it mean for digital governance?;"AdvertisementChina's Digital Silk Road (DSR) was launched in 2015 as a component of Beijing's vast vision for global connectivity, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Like the BRI, the DSR is not monolithic and involves many actors at all levels across the Chinese public and private sectors. It is amorphous and the line between official and unofficial DSR projects is often blurry. Comprehensive data on DSR investments is difficult to come by. According to one estimate, by 2018, DSR-related investments in digital infrastructure projects outside of China had reached $79 billion.The DSR aims to improve digital connectivity in participating countries, with China as the main driver of the process. On the macro level, the DSR is about the development and interoperability of critical digital infrastructure such as terrestrial and submarine data cables, 5G cellular networks, data storage centers, and global satellite navigation systems. In one of the most recent moves, China completed the launch of its global satellite system, BeiDou, which, in some regions, is more accurate than the United States' global positioning system (GPS). In Asia, Pakistan, Laos, Brunei, and Thailand are among the countries that have adopted BeiDou, and there is growing use in West Asia (the Middle East) and Africa. At the micro level, the DSR promotes connectivity between local businesses and consumers and among businesses and consumers. Examples include e-commerce, taxi-hailing, fintech (financial technology), and edtech (education technology) platforms and apps, as well as hardware such as routers, smartphones, and PCs.What Drives the DSR?The DSR is far more than just an infrastructure project. For China, the DSR is a solution that engenders a less U.S.-centric and a more Sino-centric Asian and global digital order. China pursues this goal by enabling the opening of new markets for Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Huawei, and by strengthening the world's digital connectivity with China.The DSR fits right in with the Chinese authorities' ambitious national goals such as 'Made in China 2025' and 'China Standards 2035.' These initiatives aim to enhance China's domestic tech innovation, production, and transaction capabilities. In turn, these goals are part of an overarching vision of the Chinese government for tech primacy and greater autonomy in the global digital order.Enjoying this article?

The DSR aids Chinese tech giants and smaller players to boost their sales and local knowhow and gain a foothold in overseas markets – often with the help of Chinese government policy facilitation. Regardless of what one makes of the approach, the DSR expands the oligopolistic pool of digital products and services suppliers.NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
Indeed, a small number of actors lead the tech world, and U.S. tech giants Alphabet (Google), Intel, Amazon, Cisco, and Facebook in particular have a near-global monopoly in their respective domains. For example, by the end of 2018, content providers such as Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon owned or leased more than half of the undersea cable bandwidth. These cables carry close to 98 percent of international internet data and telephone traffic. Such dominance is not healthy and several actors, including the EU and Australia, have taken steps to curb these tech giants' sway.AdvertisementThe DSR often focuses on BRI participants and developing economies; but the DSR's reach is not limited to these actors. The initiative fills digital 'voids' wherever it spots one. Top recipients of DSR investments even include large European economies such as Germany and Italy. In Europe, projects focus on 5G networks, fintech, and smart city technologies. Through competitive Chinese public-private sector partnership deals, the DSR catalyzes a more digitalized world from Serbia to Mexico to Myanmar. A more digitalized world is not exclusively beneficial to China and Chinese companies. Indeed, DSR digitalization, if accompanied by economic growth, could offer a host of spinoff investment and sales opportunities for non-Chinese tech and non-tech companies too.But There Are Significant ChallengesAs with any initiative of this scale, the DSR comes with some challenges. Particularly, these apply to existing tech giants and digital infrastructure providers who would wish to sustain their lead. Broadly, however, these challenges apply to all stakeholders who favor the vision of a more open, transparent, free, and equitable global cyber domain – and digital governance at large.In this regard, the DSR has four significant and far-reaching strategic implications. First, China can build and offer digital backbones that are almost entirely homegrown. The backbones are the infrastructure that makes digital communication possible, such as data cables, cellular networks, and data storage centers. Drawing an analogy with Legos, the more backbone China builds, the more it can build on and connect to that foundation – thus strengthening its position in the global digital order.Second, the DSR may facilitate China to set standards for digital infrastructure and next-generation tech such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, blockchain, serverless computing, and so on. Although all tech leaders seek to set standards, existing tech leaders are bound to view emerging Chinese attempts to set standards as competition. Beyond the considerations of existing tech leaders and within the wider global considerations, setting standards brings considerable strategic advantages with it. Moreover, the DSR creates digital arteries that are likely to boost Chinese supply chains, its economy, and, therefore, its overall global economic influence.Third, China's view on digital governance has a much more state-paternalistic nature. This differs starkly from the average liberal Western view on digital values and norms, especially that of the United States. The Chinese government enforces strict restrictions on the cyberspace in China. It also does not hesitate to closely monitor its netizens in a considerably sealed off domestic 'intranet.' Granted, China is certainly not the only country to practice a restrictive view on digital governance, and different countries enforce different types and levels of restrictions over cyberspace. Countries like Singapore and India tend to enforce controls on content too, and the EU, for instance, is increasingly regulating content. So, while the DSR does not promote a liberal and transparent cyber domain per se, it is important to note that there are no universal global cyber governance values. Perhaps this is reflective of the diversity of cultures and socio-political values on the human canvas – both online and offline.Fourth, Chinese businesses, and by extension, Chinese authorities, could gain access to large local data pools through the DSR. By strengthening other countries' reliance on Chinese infrastructure, Beijing could – theoretically – gain a valuable tool of local political influence, although this would depend considerably on local cybersecurity policies and enforcement capacities, among other factors. Such potential exploitation, however, is not exclusive to China. As the Edward Snowden revelations and the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal showed, any tech provider or cyber tech-advanced actor could abuse their position, if so desired.Enjoying this article?

US President Joe Biden has proposed that democratic countries form an infrastructure plan to rival China's ambitious Belt and Road (OBOR) initiative while conversing on the phone with his UK counterpart, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, on Friday.
'I suggested we should have, essentially, a similar initiative, pulling from the democratic states, helping those communities around the world that, in fact, need help,' Biden told reporters.
The two leaders had spoken to discuss their countries' respective policies regarding Iran and China, as well as ongoing global COVID-19 vaccine rollout and tackling climate change as a key part of ""building back better from the pandemic"".
""They talked about shared international challenges. The leaders agreed on the need for Iran to come back into compliance with the nuclear deal. On China, the prime minister and president reflected on the significant action taken by the UK, US and other international partners earlier this week to impose sanctions on human rights violators in Xinjiang and expressed their concern about retaliatory taken action by China,"" a Downing Street spokesperson said, quoted by Reuters.
US-China Rivalry
Joe Biden's proposal comes as on Thursday he vowed to thwart China's attempts to outpace the United States and prevail as the most powerful country in the world.
'China has an overall goal ... to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world… That's not going to happen on my watch because the United States is going to continue to grow,' Biden told reporters at the White House on Thursday, during his first press conference since his swearing-in ceremony. ​Amid the spiraling rivalry between the two global heavyweights, Biden indicated plans to unveil a multi-trillion-dollar plan to upgrade US infrastructure next week, with emphasis on promising new technologies, such as quantum computing, artificial intelligence and biotechnology.
Joe Biden also made reference to 'hours upon hours' of interaction with China's President Xi Jinping when he served as vice president under former President Barack Obama. Biden tore into the Chinese president, saying:
'He (Xi) doesn't have a democratic - with a small ‘d' - bone in his body, but he's a smart, smart guy.'
Biden's remarks fall in line with contentious public statements made days earlier during the first high-level, in-person talks between US and Chinese officials under his administration in Alaska.

The Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at the time that the US would ""discuss our deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States, economic coercion of our allies"".
Earlier, during their first phone call in February, US President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping spoke about a range of topics, including ""the shared challenges of global health security, climate change, and preventing weapons proliferation"", according to a White House release on their talks.
At the time, the POTUS referred to China as America's ""most serious competitor"" while expressingd a desire to ""work with Beijing when it's in America's interest to do so"".
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)
Washington-Beijing tensions escalated under the Donald Trump administration as the two sides found themselves embroiled in a trade spat, slapping duties on each other's goods.
Washington additionally targeted Chinese tech giants, including Huawei, accusing Beijing of an espionage campaign without offering any proof to substantiate the claims. The allegations have been dismissed by China.China was also lambasted for ostensibly lack of transparency regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, something that Beijing has also rejected vehemently.

One of China's most ambitious projects - its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) – has been a thorn in the US administration's side.
The multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure scheme launched in 2013 by President Xi Jinping and presupposing development and investment initiatives stretching from East Asia to Europe, has already drawn over 100 countries into its fold.
Agreements have been signed with Beijing to cooperate in BRI projects to build railways, ports, highways and other infrastructure.
As of mid-last year, over 2,600 projects estimated to cost around $3.7 trillion were linked to the initiative, according to a Refinitiv database.
While seen as potentially boosting China's economic and political clout, the project has raised concerns in the United States, with Washington seeking to encourage private sector investment for overseas projects to rival those of the BRI.
However, the US administration has, to date, fallen short of blueprinting a viable alternative to the state-backed global infrastructure development strategy put forward by Beijing.

The Trump administration denounced the project as 'predatory' in its 2018 National Defense Strategy, and alleged it was a manifestation of 'debt trap diplomacy.'
After Italy joined OBOR, as the initiative is also called, in March 2019, the US National Security Council tweeted that endorsing BRI ‘lends legitimacy to China's predatory approach to investment'.


Italy is a major global economy and a great investment destination. Endorsing BRI lends legitimacy to China's predatory approach to investment and will bring no benefits to the Italian people.

​Nevertheless, between 2017 and 2019, over a dozen Latin American countries and ten Caribbean nations joined OBOR, with nearly all NATO member states in Eastern and Southern Europe having associated with the project, writes Fortune. ​As part of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Beijing launched the Digital Silk Road (DSR) of undersea cables, data centers, and 5G telecommunications systems in 2015, with a ‘Polar Silk Road' seeking to link China to the Arctic and Antarctic outlined as part of its new 2021-2025 'five-year plan' published in early March and quoted by state-run Xinhua news agency.

And many of these countries may not even know all of the different ways Beijing is building influence, much less have a plan to confront it.The February report from the International Institute for Strategic Studies, or IISS, looked at China's 'Digital Silk Road' strategy, which includes technology investments, bilateral agreements to conduct research together, funding for students to learn about Chinese tech, the provision of security tech to autocratic regimes, and more. They looked specifically at Indonesia, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and Poland but the issue touches nearly every country. They found that at least 16 countries had signed memorandums of understanding with with China on projects related to the Digital Silk Road, meaning that that the two countries had reached some sort of formal understanding about, say, allowing Chinese tech in the marketplace, China hosting an education program, or launching a research program together. But the scope of Chinese tech infiltration goes well beyond those formal agreements. IISS's research showed that China had carried out projects related to the DSR, be it gaining market foothold, education, etc. in 137 countries worldwide. They found many governments were willing, to various extents, to entertain partnerships with China under the assumption that changing political winds (and changing U.S. leadership) would lead the United States to abandon its pressure campaign to urge countries to eschew Chinese technology. But they found that this hedging strategy didn't affect the countries' defense and intelligence cooperation with the United States.'The decision to exclude or limit the integration of Chinese technology by any of the governments analysed was based purely on the hypothetical consequences of not doing so for defence and intelligence cooperation with the US and allies,' the report said.In Indonesia, the report noted, the past two decades have seen Huawei become 'deeply, if not inextricably, embedded' in the country's information communications ecosystem, 'from fibre-optic cable networks thousands of kilometres long to the latest smartphones. Chinese-designed localised apps are prevalent among Indonesian smartphone users, whose communications are transmitted and relayed by Chinese-designed base-station technology and data centres. Much of the Indonesian cloud is apparently Chinese.' China is also playing a big role in Indonesia's AI research efforts. In South Korea, China uses foreign direct investment as a 'carrot-and-stick tool' to influence policy. South Korean tech imports to China have 'been centre stage in the Sino-US silicon-chip war,' they write, referring to the jockeying between U.S. and Chinese chip makers to get their chips in more electronics. That reveals 'an intricate, complex and enormously lucrative national asset which the Korean establishment will apparently defend at some cost to ROK–US relations.'Huawei has also given China an important foothold in the United Arab Emirates, or UAE. But the relationship deepened by the UAE regime's purchases of surveillance cameras and facial recognition software to police its own citizens. In Poland, China poured money into training and education, such as prize programs at a dozen Polish universities whose winners received a week of workshops at Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen, a second week in Beijing, and a smartphone. They found that Huawei had an agreement with a major Polish university just last June, which is significant because it comes after the United States had ramped up efforts to turn allies away from the Chinese telecom giant and around the same time that Polish efforts to secure a permanent U.S. base in the country failed. Even Israel, one of the United States' closest security partners, occupies 'a special place along China's Digital Silk Road,' having signed a… research and development agreement with Beijing. The Israeli Ministry of Defense, more attuned to US concerns, has been monitoring and raising concerns about China's activities since the early 2000s.' Those agreements and partnerships give China more than a foothold in markets and a toe in government policymaking. They also secure access to civilian and corporate data that can be of use to China's tech companies — and help Beijing's intelligence operatives more effectively target citizens with disinformation. 'Even if it is assumed that the risk posed by Chinese technologies to intelligence security is low, the ability to harness big data should be of concern to defence industries as it has relevance to future competitiveness in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI),' they write. The biggest problem, IISS found, is that governments are taking no steps to determine how much or what kind of Chinese investment posed a possible risk. 'Debates also focused largely on whether to accept toplevel Chinese physical infrastructure and did not, for example, seem to delve into debates around whether to rely on imports of copper wire from China, or whether to permit Chinese investment into local start-up industries. It would thus seem from this research that it is difficult for national-level governments to precisely determine what level of integration of Chinese ICT technologies should be considered significant.';defenseone.com;6116;news;US;en;['Patrick Tucker, Defense One'];https://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2021/02/23/NGhuawei20210223/open-graph.jpg;False;;26.122269;284ec9acae121f1f838a72471ba8ce90;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND DSR', 'lang': 'en', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'from': '3 years ago', 'sort_by': 'date', 'page': 1}

Andy Wong/Pool via REUTERS In recent months, two major events in the Middle East—a burst of diplomatic relations for Israel and the end of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) crisis—have changed the regional landscape. Both episodes were driven by regional actors responding largely to pressures and opportunities within their countries and the broader Middle East, while the role of the United States has been an important factor. Though China was not involved in either development, change in the Middle East presents opportunities for Beijing as well.  The dramatic announcement that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Israel were normalizing relations on August 14, 2020 was the first such event. While deep ties between Israel and the GCC countries were the worst-kept secret in the Middle East, there was little indication that they were ready to take this step. China was clearly caught off-guard; Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Zhao Lijian was tepid in his response the day after the announcement, referring only to China's ongoing support for Palestine. Given Chinese cooperation with both the UAE and Israel, however, it is clear that normalization supports Beijing's regional interests. For one thing, it facilitates cooperation between two of China's most important Middle East and North Africa (MENA) partners in its Digital Silk Road (DSR) initiative. Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI), a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company referred to as the 'Huawei of genomics,' signed an agreement in 2019 with Abu Dhabi's Group 42 (G42), a firm that is central to the UAE's growing AI ambitions. Little noticed at the time, the agreement came into the spotlight in March 2020 when the two companies were used to support the UAE's COVID-19 response by providing tracking and tracing technology. BGI has made inroads throughout the Middle East and also signed an agreement to build a coronavirus testing lab in Israel. Several Chinese tech companies, including Alibaba, AliExpress, and Huawei, have made inroads into Israel with digital investments, and Israel is seen as an important partner in the DSR. The UAE and Israel have been quick to cooperate in tech sectors; G42 announced plans to open an office in Tel Aviv, where they expect to collaborate on AI research, agricultural and water supply technology, renewable energy, and smart city development. A UAE-Israel tech axis creates a DSR foothold in the Middle East for Chinese firms. Geopolitically, China also benefits from Israel having normalized ties with Arab countries in the Gulf. The European Union is China's largest trading partner, making the Mediterranean Sea a major endpoint in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). An Israel integrated into its own region provides yet another important access point to the Mediterranean, especially if and when connecting infrastructure comes into effect. The proposed Red-Med railway and the ambitious 'Tracks for Regional Peace' that would link Haifa port to the Gulf underscore Israel's geostrategic importance. This is especially crucial for China's BRI ambitions of cross-regional connectivity.  In short, Israel's growing diplomatic role in the Middle East is a net good for almost everyone and, like many countries with interests in the region, China stands to benefit.  The second major event was the end of the GCC dispute. As with diplomatic normalization, China had nothing to do with this, but it stands to gain here as well. In ending Qatar's isolation, the US seems to have been a major consideration for decision-makers in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, and the UAE. President Donald Trump's initial support for the blockade was a trigger, much like President Joe Biden taking office was a trigger for its end. This is largely a story about long-standing tensions on the Arabian Peninsula—made more complicated by partnerships and alliances with the US. Where does China fit in? In the year leading up to the crisis, China and the GCC had held four rounds of talks to finalize a free trade agreement that they'd been negotiating on-and-off since 2004. During President Xi Jinping's state visit to Saudi Arabia in January 2016, he made it clear that China was ready to get serious about the deal and set 2017 as a deadline. Negotiating a multilateral deal with the Gulf Cooperation Council was not going to happen with a broken GCC, so it's been on hold. We can expect to see talks resume soon, which will facilitate a China-GCC free trade agreement that will have important consequences for an already impressive set of economic relationships. The shifting MENA context also matters because relations between China and Qatar have been on the back burner since 2017. In 2014, Emir Tamim bin Hamada al Thani visited Beijing for a state visit and signed a strategic partnership agreement. There was serious momentum, with over $8 billion in infrastructure and development contracts, including the high-profile Lusail Stadium—the opening and closing venue for the FIFA World Cup in 2022. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's Doha branch was designated as a renminbiclearing center in 2015, making it the first institution in the Middle East to cover transactions in Chinese yuan and was used for a remarkable $86 billion worth of deals by the time of the crisis. This burst of momentum halted with Qatar isolated in the Gulf, while other countries, especially the UAE, enjoyed a surge in deals with China. The BRI features here as well. It's a series of projects promoting connectivity, and since 2017 Qatar has connected to very little. With Qatar presumably coming back into the fold, it will likely enjoy a corresponding spike in Chinese projects. China isn't unique in these two cases.

The DSR is part of the broader Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The fiber cable will link to the Pakistan East Africa Connecting Europe (PEACE) submarine cable in the Arabian Sea, to service countries participating in BRI, and Europe. It is currently being laid between Pakistan's Rawalpindi city and the port cities of Karachi and Gwadar. The $240-million project, which is in partnership with China's Huawei Technologies, was approved by the government last week.The laying of sea cable in Pakistan's territorial waters will begin in March, following government approval this month for Cybernet, a local internet service provider, to construct an Arabian Sea landing station in Karachi.The Mediterranean section of the cable is already being laid, and runs from Egypt to France. The 15,000 kilometer-long cable is expected to go into service later this year.

It is expected to help reduce Pakistan's exposure to internet outages from damaged submarine cables by providing an additional route for internet connectivity.According to Eyck Freymann, author of ‘One Belt One Road: Chinese Power Meets the World,' the BRI is evolving to place less emphasis on traditional heavy infrastructure, and more on high-tech cooperation and digital services.READ MORE: China's Belt and Road is the way for Europe and Asia to cut colonial Western ties and prosperHe told Nikkei Asia that ""Beijing wants to dominate the physical infrastructure underlying global communications, particularly the internet,' adding: ""This will give it an advantage in internationalizing its tech sector and pursuing future tech-related deals with partner countries.""The ambitious multi-trillion-dollar BRI initiative (or the new Silk Road), announced by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, aims to boost connectivity and cooperation between East Asia, Europe, and East Africa. It is expected to significantly boost global trade, cutting trading costs in half for the countries involved, according to expert estimates.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section";RT;506;news;RU;en;['RT'];https://cdni.rt.com/files/2021.01/article/6013e35b85f54064173f04a5.jpg;False;;39.30251;1e92d132c5b945d034d712d3f70fe24c;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND DSR', 'lang': 'en', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'from': '3 years ago', 'sort_by': 'date', 'page': 1}
61;For Indonesia, Chinese 5G Cooperation Brings Promise and Peril;Sebastian Strangio;2021-01-20 13:04:43;full;https://thediplomat.com/2021/01/for-indonesia-chinese-5g-cooperation-brings-promise-and-peril;thediplomat.com;Like many nations, Indonesia faces a difficult decision about how far to engage with China's Digital Silk Road.;AdvertisementEarlier this month, on his four-nation tour of Southeast Asia, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Indonesia, during which the two sides discussed cooperation on the development of 5G networks in the archipelago.Under the leadership of Xi Jinping, China has stepped up its global engagement in a host of economic and political domains. An important part of this is positioning China as a global technological leader, which has taken place under the aegis of the Digital Silk Road (DSR) a major pillar of the Belt and Road Initiative that was established in 2013.The DSR is has the aim of expanding China's digital connections abroad and thus increasing its commercial and political influence.The telecommunications firm Huawei is one of China's mainstays in its DSR push, helping to develop  5G networks in various countries, including Indonesia. Since 2009, Huawei has invested $600 million in research for the development of 5G technology globally. In more recent years, it has also offered to help governments build their 5G networks, an offer made attractive by the fact that its technology is much more affordable than competing products produced by Western firms.NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter However, several countries have also boycotted collaboration with Huawei on 5G due to concerns about national security, including the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Britain, and Canada. In addition, France and Japan have also indirectly prohibited the use of technology assembled by Huawei.Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.In Indonesia, however, the country has welcomed with open arms both the arrival of Huawei and of the DSR more broadly. Last year, Huawei announced that it was collaborating with the country's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT). The government of President Joko Widodo views collaboration between Huawei and Indonesia's technology industry, government, and universities as central to achieving its goal of producing a creative and digital economy by 2035 and a 'more developed' nation by 2045.This collaboration currently takes place in three fields: artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 5G networks. On the first two counts, Huawei is involved in developing BPPT's capacity and helping the agency develop and apply AI and cloud computing in the Indonesian economy.However, the government in Jakarta is still unsure of Indonesia's readiness to make the leap to 5G technology, the Head of Human Resources Development Research, Basuki Yusuf Iskandar recently told the local media.AdvertisementIskandar believes that before Indonesia can build a 5G network, it must take into account several factors beyond the basic technological challenges: namely, whether Indonesia's industry and regulatory capacities, as well as the population as a whole, are ready to make the transition. He added that if this readiness is lacking, the implementation of this 5G network will not bring the expected economic returns.To assist with this, Huawei is helping prep the 5G market in Indonesia in several ways. First, the company is helping to educate the public about 5G technology and its potential benefits. Muhammad Rosidi, Huawei's national ICT strategy and marketing director in Indonesia, stated recently that the firm has played an important role in disseminating information about 5G and its potential benefits to the Indonesian public. Huawei is also ready to help accelerate the digitalization of infrastructure in Indonesia, specifically by helping develop the capacity of government workers.Second, Huawei last year also began collaborating with the Indonesian Presidential Staff Office to put 100,000 Indonesian officials through a five-year vocational training course in digital literacy. Third, Huawei also pledged to develop infrastructure such as band transceiver stations, or towers, that can facilitate wireless communication in various regions so that 5G technology can be accessed evenly across the Indonesian islands.China's interest in implementing the DSR in Indonesia is not surprising, given that the country has the sixth-largest internet user base in the world. This gives Chinese companies like Huawei added motivation for making Indonesia a priority market, including on 5G infrastructure development.As this cooperation advances, however, Indonesia's embrace of the DSR raises some concerns. Despite Huawei's efforts, questions remain around equality of access to 5G technology, given that the present internet infrastructure is still not developed equally across the country..There is also a worry that DSR will allow China to surveil the Indonesian government, or that the latter will use Chinese technologies to spy on its own people. It is crucial to note that firms from China have already assisted governments in some parts of the world with developing surveillance capabilities that could be used against dissidents and opposition groups. China has also helped train foreign government officials on how to monitor and censor the internet.As for Indonesia, it has signed with China a memorandum of understanding on boosting internet security and tech cooperation, the first such agreement signed between China and a foreign countryEnjoying this article?

In 2018, China flagged its global interest in the Arctic region as a key facet of its Belt and Road Initiative—with the…;In our global information age, connectivity plays a central role. The geopolitics of connectivity is increasingly garnering attention, presenting various challenges and opportunities. Unfolding in real-time is a new great game of sorts: the digitalization of the Arctic. Stakeholders range from public to private enterprises and include autocratic and democratic governments. The 'prize' is control over the flow of information within the Arctic, which affords both political and economic windfalls. Of course, restricting access to information is a well-known playbook of states like China, North Korea and Iran. After all, information is power.   Economically, digitalization directly improves living standards, an important precursor to socio-economic development. Indeed, the key economic drawcard for digitalization in the Arctic is the geographic reality that the region is the shortest distance connecting Europe to Asia. In tech-speak, this means data fiber-cables are shorter which translates to optimal latency. Latency, the holy grail of digital communication, is essentially the 'delay' in which information moves between origin and destination. The global financial system is merely one key sector that has its eye on the prime latency which Arctic digital avenues provide. Traditional security challenges like great-power politics, resource politics, and the contemporary climate change threat, are the usual headlines of Arctic security coverage. We outline Russia's digitization strategy and argue, in the Arctic context, the geopolitics of connectivity is somewhat overlooked. The Arctic's digital transformation matters, as global connectivity becomes increasingly weaponized.   Digitalization, With Russian Characteristics   Russia's new prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, has a tech-savvy reputation. Indeed, since assuming the prime ministership in 2020, Mishustin has sought to elevate digitalization on Moscow's policy agenda. The urgency of developing Russia's digital footprint has been underscored by the global coronavirus pandemic, which gave an impetus to accelerate digital transformation across Russia. An increased demand for online services, e-commerce and technological solutions as a result of enforced lockdowns and the pandemic's 'new normal' has forced Mishustin's government to double-down on its digitalization agenda. This has become a national development goal, and the Russian Arctic is one key theatre in which Russia is accelerating its digital transformation. Russia's digitalization of the Arctic has emerged as a cross-cutting solution serving a number of purposes. Of course, digitalization is expected to mitigate several threats as identified in Russia's latest Arctic strategy to 2035. First, Moscow sees digitalization as the central way in which to improve the socio-economic conditions of the Russian Arctic region. The Russian Arctic zone is deprived of adequate telecommunications infrastructure, making living conditions particularly harsh. The region suffers from a digital divide, as the villages of eastern Russian Arctic regions are not connected to the internet. The pandemic has only underscored the importance of telecommunications infrastructure in providing primary health care to these remote indigenous communities, including telemedicine. Of course, their military bases and energy extraction sites are afforded access. This digital isolation has contributed to the demographic challenges viewed by Moscow as one of the major threats to its Arctic development. By improving digital connectivity, the Russian state hopes to halt out-migration from the region, deliver on the promise to guarantee high living standards, and, ultimately, attract more settlers to the Russian High North. The labor-intensive energy sectors of the Arctic require adequate manpower well into the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the development of digital connectivity is the cornerstone of Russia's plans for infrastructure build-ups and energy exploration along the Northern Sea Route (NSR). Better digital connectivity can enhance Russia's defense capabilities, maritime navigation and energy exploration. With Arctic sea ice melting, the NSR is emerging as a globally competitive transport corridor and the digitalization of logistics would make energy exports more efficient.   Moscow views digital connectivity as a backbone for attracting the much needed private investments - domestic and foreign - and spurring economic activity in non-energy sectors. The current resource-based economic model is reaching its limit and new drivers for economic growth are needed. Luring private capital and investment can diminish the region's dependence on energy extraction and resource rents. The creation of network infrastructure is expected to provide a foundation for smaller businesses to invest in the High North and, ultimately, foster the long-awaited economic development.  China Enters the Arctic Digitization Race  Moscow is not alone in eying the potential of the Arctic's digital silk roads. In 2018, China flagged its global interest in the Arctic region as a key facet of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)—with the High North featuring as the Polar Silk Road. While high-level assessment of Beijing's Arctic strategy tends to focus on the growing Chinese footprint in the region (rationalized by Beijing in terms of environmental stewardship of the Arctic 'commons'), China's Arctic reach is also evident in the connectivity sphere. Indeed, within the digitalization context, China has taken a partnership approach to developing its data interests. Given the geographical position of Russia and its frontier Arctic Ocean proximity—ideal for running data cables linking in the shortest distance possible Asia and Europe—China is looking to partner with Moscow on more than just energy projects. Beijing's own strategic interest in the development of its Digital Silk Road (DSR) component of the BRI dovetails nicely with the emerging Arctic theatre. A key aim of the DSR is of course to market Chinese-state technology and Chinese tech solutions for digital projects internationally. While this agenda may be primarily commercial given its role within the BRI context—it is the case that military-security concerns arise from the strategic edge afforded to China in the context of DSR state technology. Beijing's interest in expanding the DSR to the Russian Arctic is cautiously welcomed by Moscow. Russia has a cash-flow problem, in dire need of capital investment and China is working hard to capitalize on Moscow's limited access to Western funds. Recently, China has targeted Russian Arctic energy ventures to participate in by way of capital injections. However, Arctic digital infrastructure projects are emerging as an increasingly attractive sector for China—further representing another sphere of win-win cooperation within the broader mutually beneficial Sino-Russian partnership. That said, Chinese capital does not make Russia and China natural allies in the digital sphere. Lingering bilateral mistrust perseveres and Moscow would ideally promote Russian-made technology for its digital economy. Problem is, home-grown Russian solutions are slow off the mark. From the Russian perspective, companies like Huawei undermine Moscow's sovereignty in terms of information security. This would appear to be a concern Russia shares with the West. But in light of weaponized technology being somewhat unavoidable, it is perhaps the case that the Kremlin would rather expose itself to the risk of being wiretapped by the Chinese than being vulnerable to Western technology.  Surveying Key Arctic Digitization Projects  Given the importance of digital transformation and global data, it is no surprise the Russian government has encouraged the development of a number of connectivity projects. Essentially, Moscow's goal is to create favorable business conditions for the IT sector—sort of a Silicon Valley in the High North. Following the Nordic countries' suit, there has been an uptick in the installation of data centers in the Russian Arctic, which is a preemptive move given the need for data processing and storage capacity will only increase. The frigid Arctic environment is a natural fit for data centers too. Indeed, the cold climate could potentially allow Russian policymakers to reduce the costs of data infrastructure development with savings from reduced requirements for cooling equipment and lower electricity demands. Further projects in the broader digitalization sphere include data processing hubs for mining cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, platforms for running unmanned transport prospecting and extracting remote energy deposits, and the facilitation of the 5G network. Sea cables are an emerging priority in the Arctic great game. Internationally, the geostrategic priority of sea cables is well known: they account for 99 percent of all telecommunication data flows. It is perhaps no surprise that the most ambitious digitization project is therefore a sea cable in the Russian Arctic. The project dubbed Arctic Connect, consists of a data cable over ten thousand kilometers long and is illustrated in Figure 1. The project is led by Finnish state-owned company Cinia Oy in partnership with Russian telecommunications provider MegaFon. Revived for good in 2016, Arctic Connect plans to link Europe and Asia through a submarine communication/data cable laid along the NSR. This trans-Arctic cable will provide an extremely reliable internet connection for users due to lower latency between the two continents. Further insurances include reduced likelihood of disruptions (a problem plaguing global sea cables), including damage caused by human activity,  given the rather uncongested NSR. Arctic Connect is essentially two separate data cable systems: one system will offer the international community an incomparable low-latency internet connection between European and Asian users, and the other system will connect regional Russian coastal cities to broadband internet. The project is expected to come to fruition by 2023 and is estimated to cost up to $1.2 billion. According to Gevork Vermishyan, general manager of MegaFon, Arctic Connect will become a driver for the development of the digital economy in the region, including Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things.;Copyright 1991-2019 The National interest;2924;news;US;en;['Maria Shagina, Elizabeth Buchanan'];https://nationalinterest.org/sites/default/files/main_images/2020-04-06T000000Z_598753543_RC20ZF9LNA4F_RTRMADP_3_RUSSIA-PUTIN%20copy.jpg;False;;30.242521;15015e7232fe05911612664efe4efa10;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND DSR', 'lang': 'en', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'from': '3 years ago', 'sort_by': 'date', 'page': 1}
63;The battle to modernize Japan;Jun Mukoyama;2021-01-05 08:00:00;full;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2021/01/05/commentary/japan-commentary/modernize-japan;japantimes.co.jp;In a country of fax machines and fragmented central administration, Suga's vision of a digital agency looks hard to achieve.;"The creation of a digital agency is a top policy priority for Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.However, the protracted distribution of a ¥100,000 handout for each resident amid the coronavirus pandemic and the use of fax, now essentially obsolete in most other nations, for reporting COVID-19 infections have laid bare the government's delay in taking advantage of digital technology.Though the country possesses quality communications infrastructures, such as fiber optic and mobile phone networks, these have not been utilized sufficiently, with little emphasis on the convenience of users as the starting point — a situation that digital transformation minister Takuya Hirai repeatedly called 'the defeat in the digital war.'The coronavirus pandemic has provided an unprecedented opportunity for the government to develop its digital strategies, which it had struggled to push through, with numerous failed attempts in the past two decades. Globally, an intensifying competition for national cyberpower is playing out. Japan stands at a crossroads right now and must determine whether it will also suffer a defeat in the competitive global cyberspace.When we consider using the economy as a weapon to solve geopolitical problems, one of the major strategies is to acquire the latest technology and command control over the international standards for the next generation's leading industries. Cyberspace has emerged as one of the main battlegrounds for competing powers that fully utilize the support of the private sector.History shows that the world has always maintained order based on the power balance of nations. Alfred Mahan stressed the importance of sea power in the age of imperialism, while it was nuclear power that swayed the balance during the Cold War. After the Cold War came soft power, touted by Joseph Nye, which emphasizes countries' cooperation rather than the use of coercion when one country wants to reach a desired outcome.As the times changed, so did the force that defined the ages. Now national cyberpower has surfaced as a deciding force that will determine the rise and fall of various countries. In the age of geoeconomics, cyberspace has jumped to center stage of the national power game, and that is further intensifying the power game of geoeconomics.In September, the Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs announced the National Cyber Power Index 2020. The U.S. topped the ranking, followed by China, while Japan was ranked ninth, behind European nations such as the United Kingdom, France and Germany.China's Digital Silk Road project is playing an important role in that country's broader Belt and Road initiative. Under the DSR, $17 billion (¥1.8 trillion) worth of investments have been carried out since 2013 not only on network equipment and infrastructure, such as 5G and fiber optic cables, but also in various sectors, such as data and research facilities, smart cities, large-scale e-commerce and smartphone settlements.These measures represent a credible international strategy that has allowed China to play a leadership role as a cyber superpower and also lead directly to the growth strategy of Chinese enterprises. Even though the government and companies may not be able to operate as one in Japan as they do in China, as the whole of Japan pushes for digitalization, we will need a clear vision on how it will translate into national power or how Japan will position itself in the international context.Security in cyberpower The National Cyber Power Index research team measured countries' cyber capabilities in the context of seven national objectives that countries pursue using digital means.The seven objectives are: Surveilling and Monitoring Domestic Groups; Strengthening and Enhancing National Cyber Defenses; Controlling and Manipulating the Information Environment; Foreign Intelligence Collection for National Security; Commercial Gain or Enhancing Domestic Industry Growth; Destroying or Disabling an Adversary's Infrastructure and Capabilities; and Defining International Cyber Norms and Technical Standards.These are all important objectives to allow countries to maintain hegemony over cyberspace. To make substantial progress on the digitalization of the economy and society as well as digital transformation, cybersecurity defense, once everything is connected to the internet, would be essential.Moreover, cybersecurity nowadays has played a critical role in protecting not only companies and the economy from cyberattacks, but also in ensuring national defense against cyberattacks on important infrastructure. As a result of Russia's attempts to meddle with the U.S. Presidential election in 2016, cybersecurity has expanded its role to protecting democracy and society.For Japan, cybersecurity is not somebody else's business. According to the U.K. Foreign Office, Russian military intelligence attempted to obstruct the Tokyo Olympics, which was scheduled to be held in 2020. The number of cyberattacks has doubled following an increasing shift to telework amid the coronavirus pandemic, while cyberattacks that targeted information on coronavirus vaccine development have been reported recently. A ¥100,000 per person handout during the pandemic exposed the weaknesses of Japan's central administration, with long queues and a complicated application process hampering efforts. | KYODO A commanding role in cyberspace In Japan, the Basic Act on Cybersecurity, which passed the Diet in 2014, serves as the foundation for related policies. In 2016, the law was amended to strengthen the function of the National center of Incident readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC) at the Cabinet Secretariat and again in 2018 to set up a cybersecurity committee to allow the government and private sector to work together to share information ahead of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics.But Japan fared poorly, especially in intelligence gathering, in the National Cyber Power Index, as it has failed to streamline the law to make reporting of cybersecurity incidents mandatory, or install a system of aggregating information to make appropriate detection, analysis, judgement and responses to cyberthreats.NISC, which plays a central role in improving the government's cybersecurity, is only tasked with dealing with the government and government agencies as part of its mission, and is not responsible for ensuring the cybersecurity of society as a whole, leaving the private sector to make voluntary efforts.Because NISC's main role is general coordination, it also cannot aggregate information by eliminating the vertically segmented administrative system or issue an alert to the government on its own, even if infrastructure under the jurisdiction of government ministries and agencies was to be hit by a cybersecurity incident.Unless we eliminate the compartmentalized government structure, not only in administrative service and digitalization but also in cybersecurity, the digital agency's control tower function will likely be insufficient. A lack of expert personnel in cybersecurity is also a serious issue, as is the overall digital problem. We need to set up a structure through which experts who can communicate with professionals in other countries are nurtured and constantly hired, and new expertise continues to be developed at the organizations.What is to be called for in the digital agency is the function of a conning tower to improve cybersecurity in the overall society in cooperation with the Self-Defense Forces and the Defense Ministry, which defend against attacks, and the National Policy Agency, which cracks down on cybercrimes.A global sphere To achieve those goals, the first step would be to analyze the factors behind the 'defeat in the digital war' and have the government realize digital services that citizens feel are convenient. That's because we cannot make progress unless the government wins appreciation and trust from its own citizens for administrative services.But at the same time, we cannot forget the fact that cyberspace is a global sphere. No matter how we push ahead with the digital transformation, it would have to meet the geoeconomic challenge of a cutthroat competition in the global cyberpower game. Sadly, the Japanese government is nowhere near acquiring an integrated core function that would nurture, exercise and defend national cyberpower, the most vital national strength of the 21st century.Former U.S. President John F. Kennedy once said that 'a nation can be no stronger abroad than she is at home,' but we must realize that we cannot put in place cybersecurity that is beyond our national cyberpower.Jun Mukoyama is a fellow at API.

Announced in 2015 with a loose mandate, the DSR has become a significant part of Beijing's overall BRI strategy, under which China provides aid, political support, and other assistance to recipient states. DSR also provides support to Chinese exporters, including many well-known Chinese technology companies, such as Huawei. The DSR assistance goes toward improving recipients' telecommunications networks, artificial intelligence capabilities, cloud computing, e-commerce and mobile payment systems, surveillance technology, smart cities, and other high-tech areas.
China has already signed agreements on DSR cooperation with, or provided DSR-related investment to, at least sixteen countries. But the true number of agreements and investments is likely much larger, because many of these go unreported: memoranda of understanding (MOUs) do not necessarily show whether China and another country have embarked upon close cooperation in the digital sphere. Some estimates suggest that one-third of the countries participating in BRI—138 at this point—are cooperating on DSR projects. More on: Asia China Belt and Road Initiative Chinese firms are bringing technology and additional benefits to developing countries by establishing training centers and research and development programs to boost cooperation between scientists and engineers in these countries and their Chinese counterparts, and to transfer technical knowledge in areas such as smart cities, artificial intelligence and robotics, and clean energy, among others. Still, some democracies have raised serious concerns about the Digital Silk Road. They worry that China will use DSR to enable recipient countries to adopt its model of technology-enabled authoritarianism, which would be detrimental to personal freedoms and sovereignty in those countries. Moreover, allowing Chinese firms to build countries' fifth-generation (5G) networks and other infrastructure, and to set technology standards that could become the norm in many countries, could risk espionage and coercion of other states' politics if Beijing used data breaches to blackmail political elites in those states.

Chinese firms are bringing additional benefits to developing countries by establishing training centers and research and development programs to boost cooperation between scientists and engineers, and to transfer technical knowledge in many areas.Still, some democracies have raised serious concerns about the Digital Silk Road. They worry that, at a time when Beijing is becoming more assertive globally, China will use DSR to enable recipient countries to adopt its model of technology-enabled authoritarianism. Chinese technology companies have already helped governments in other countries develop surveillance capabilities that could be used against opposition groups, and Beijing has provided training for interested DSR recipient countries on how to monitor and censor the internet. Although some of these Chinese companies are nominally private, even the private firms have drawn global scrutiny for state links as they are required by Chinese cybersecurity legislation to store data on servers in China and submit to checks from authorities.Moreover, allowing Chinese firms to build countries' fifth-generation (5G) networks and other infrastructure, and to set technology standards, could risk espionage and coercion of other states' politics if Beijing used data breaches to blackmail political elites in those states. DSR could also help recipient countries better control their internets through filtering, content moderation, data localization, and surveillance. Doing so might accelerate a fracturing of the global internet, as some countries pursue these policies of internet control while others remain committed to internet freedoms.Enjoying this article?

Ecuador has participated in the Digital Silk Road in several ways. It has worked with China on a smart cities program designed to reduce crime. This system relies on footage from more than four thousand Chinese-made cameras installed throughout the country. Following the system's installation, the cameras will likely have facial recognition capabilities. In addition, several Ecuadorean hospitals have begun using artificial intelligence-enabled COVID-19 diagnostic tools developed by the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei.NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
Although the installation of the surveillance cameras coincided with a drop in crime rates across Ecuador, camera footage, initially thought to be sent to the police, is also being sent to the country's domestic intelligence agency. In the past, the agency has regularly tracked and intimidated political opponents. In addition, Chinese investment in the country has been implicated in multiple high-profile corruption cases, as well as a significant debt to China. Ecuador has sought to renegotiate its debt with Beijing and has also agreed to export 80 percent of its crude oil to China to repay some of its debts.AdvertisementIn other countries, like Egypt, concerns about the DSR are more about the possibility that it will play a role in exporting a controlled type of domestic internet. China has courted North Africa and the Middle East as part of its technology push; it reportedly has signed Digital Silk Road memoranda of understanding with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. Cooperation has moved quickly with Egypt. In 2019, Egyptian officials visiting China met leaders of ten major Chinese firms to discuss increasing investment in areas including artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and telecommunications infrastructure. Huawei has built a cloud computing center in Egypt, and China is increasing financing to Egypt's telecommunications sector.Egypt desperately needs to upgrade its crumbling infrastructure and gain access to inexpensive 5G. But Chinese technical assistance could enhance the Egyptian government's ability to crack down on internet freedoms. In recent years, Beijing has held training for Egyptian officials on censorship; such training could have provided an impetus for Egypt to adopt a 2018 cybercrime law that moves the country closer to China's internet model. The law expands the government's ability to censor online information and punish those who publish or even access certain information.Or, the DSR could help authoritarian leaders stay in power in other ways. Zambia has cooperated on Digital Silk Road projects with China, particularly in upgrades to Zambia's wireless networks. Huawei is building Zambia's 5G network, as it is in many countries across Africa. Huawei has also built the data center that stores and processes the Zambian government's data.  But as Zambia, once a democratic success story in southern Africa, slides toward authoritarianism, its technology cooperation with China could further empower Zambia's rulers. Huawei reportedly has provided technology to help the Zambian government spy on political opponents — a situation reportedly repeated in Uganda, where Huawei has helped the government monitor political rivals. But concerns about China's influence in Zambia are likely being suppressed; the government of President Edgar Lungu has also worked to censor and discourage criticism of China in Zambian media outlets.Some democracies also worry that DSR projects could help the Chinese government gain access to sensitive data. While U.S. officials have pressured central and east European states not to use Chinese companies to build telecommunications and other infrastructure, Serbia has tried to balance between the U.S. and China. Although European countries have agreed upon a plan to limit Huawei's penetration, Serbia has welcomed Huawei's assistance in upgrading its digital infrastructure.Both the U.S. government and some European states worry that the Chinese government could obtain backdoor access to data on Huawei networks in Serbia. A secret backdoor for Chinese intelligence, and possibly the Chinese military, would be especially concerning to European states; Serbia has close links with the EU. Probably to assuage the U.S., the Serbian government has committed to Washington that it will prohibit the use of 'untrusted' 5G providers, which the White House surely intends to mean Huawei. Yet the Serbian government has given no indication that it actually intends to ban Huawei from its 5G network.Forging on with the DSR These existing Digital Silk Road deals are just the start. Beijing is making DSR a bigger foreign policy priority, as the United States, Australia, Japan, and some European states ban Chinese tech firms from their 5G infrastructure and launch broader strategies to limit Chinese tech giants' expansion. Chinese technology firms therefore need even greater growth in developing markets if they are excluded from wealthier states.Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.The coronavirus pandemic, which has led many governments to monitor their populations, has only added to the demand in developing states for Chinese telecommunications and surveillance tools. Beijing has linked DSR to the Health Silk Road, a subset of the BRI that supports health infrastructure.But as DSR expands, concerns about its influence on recipient states will likely mount as well. Some developing countries, such as India, have expressed similar qualms as the U.S. and Europe about China's tech offensive. Beijing's increasingly nationalist diplomacy is also undermining its efforts to assuage policymakers in developing states about the potential downsides of DSR and BRI.To be sure, China is not the only country whose major tech companies have participated in surveillance, cooperation with their countries' militaries, and espionage abroad. Some U.S. tech giants have also used their networks to facilitate surveillance, espionage, and defense operations. U.S. companies such as Gatekeeper Systems also have sold facial recognition technology to authoritarian states such as Saudi Arabia. And, regardless of China's actions, many governments have clear demands for surveillance and artificial intelligence, as well as other technologies that raise privacy concerns.AdvertisementDespite questions raised about aspects of DSR, Beijing will keep pushing forward. China has already spent an estimated $79 billion on DSR-related projects, and its DSR assistance will likely grow substantially throughout the 2020s. At major China-sponsored international summits such as the World Internet Conference, Beijing has promoted DSR as a priority.As the Digital Silk Road expands, the conflicts around it — between countries signing up for DSR and those concerned about its downsides and between groups within countries worried about its detrimental effects and some governments that stand to benefit — will only intensify.Joshua Kurlantzick is Senior Fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations.This article is excerpted from a new CFR Interactive on the Digital Silk Road, which can be accessed here.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat-2020-12-15-1.jpg;False;;42.865353;81bcb48fb068dfc68ec4913c417baf95;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND DSR', 'lang': 'en', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'from': '3 years ago', 'sort_by': 'date', 'page': 1}

Credit: AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, FileAdvertisement'New Value Together' was the slogan for the 40th annual GITEX Technology Week, the only in-person global technology show of 2020 held December 6 to 10 at the Dubai World Trade Center. Its organizer is known across the Middle East – particularly the GCC countries – as the region's leader in 5G and cloud computing: Huawei.The global telecoms supplier and mobile phone manufacturer made headlines throughout 2020 – most recently in Southeast Asia with a blitz of deals monopolizing Indonesia's 5G network – for its role in a growing global 5G movement. Eleven telecom firms including those in the Gulf Cooperation countries (GCC) of the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Oman have signed massive 5G contracts with Huawei over the last year.By 2025, GCC countries will house much of the world's growing 5G subscribers. Huawei has jumped on the bandwagon to capitalize on what they perceive as a promising future for 5G in the Middle East. The company's leadership has been bullish on the Middle East since September 2019. And the region's $164 billion annual market for information and communication technology (ICT) products is a good reason for Huawei's enthusiasm. Over the last year, there has been a surge in publicly administered cloud services in the Gulf worth nearly $3 billion. This Gulf government-led push is confirming for Huawei that 5G-enabled cloud computing in the GCC is an increasingly lucrative market.But what impact has this recent growth in 5G had on the everyday lives of the 54 million people living in the GCC? Not much. Locally, 5G is mostly being implemented widely only insofar as to enable a more rapid pace of downloads to smartphones and quicker analog communications. As of December 1, Huawei's new P40 PRO 5G phone is available for consumer purchase in the UAE. But analysts remain optimistic on the potential of 5G to positively impact multiple industries in the GCC, specifically energy usage optimization, cloud computing, ultrafast broadband, and internet of things (IoT) innovation, including self-driving cars, transportation, and factory equipment.In response, Huawei has been relentlessly extending its digital footprint across the Middle East despite Western efforts to curtail its global expansion. The United States has repeatedly expressed security concerns over Huawei's presence in international markets. Since 2018, U.S. policymakers have been actively attempting to hinder the company and its China-side competitor ZTE's expansion abroad, especially within the European Union. The Trump administration's pressure on Huawei – specifically its recent ploy to curb critical semiconductor technology sales to the Chinese company – has sparked global discussions about data privacy and security-related drawbacks to international reliance on Huawei's toolkit.Enjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.While the U.S. government's efforts to halt Huawei's expansion have succeeded domestically and in parts of Europe, the Gulf market has come out unscathed. This is perhaps due to the region's highly sensitive position in geopolitics. Given a heavy reliance on China's oil market as well as the significant U.S. military and diplomatic presence, there is no incentive for Gulf economies to become a proxy war zone for the world's two largest superpowers.But COVID-19 has made Gulf economies increasingly reliant on China as the nation's economy recovers faster than the United States' from the global recession. Since COVID-19 restrictions lifted in China, Chinese policymakers have undertaken major steps to develop what they are calling 'industrial internet' of global telecommunications providers at far cheaper prices than their Western competitors in the sector. Saudi Telecom Company (STC) reported a jump of over 1,000 percent in bandwidth due to the surge in remote education. They are currently scrambling to secure necessary network infrastructure to keep pace with the demands of Saudi's ambitious Vision 2030 strategy. Similarly, Qatar is preparing to host in 2022 what it hopes will be the first 5G World Cup. The event's reliance on a critical partnership between British telecom giant Vodafone and Huawei may be jilted from the U.K.'s recent ban on Huawei products, making the battle for 5G in the region over the next few years ever more relevant.NGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.Get the Newsletter 
Huawei's aforementioned growth in global 5G has occupied much of the 2020 conversation on Chinese companies comprising China's Digital Silk Road (DSR) initiative. The phrase DSR was initially launched in a government white paper in 2015 as an extension of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a global strategy for Chinese-led infrastructure development. Now the DSR is a widely used moniker for Chinese data and telecoms activity abroad. According to Fudan University, the DSR policy itself is comprised of five key aspects: with infrastructure at its core, the DSR relies on expanding influence to trade, finance, and 'people's hearts,' all geared toward shaping policies abroad. These include cybersecurity, digital governance, and data sharing practices across the developing world.AdvertisementBoth the BRI and DSR act in practice as catch-all monikers for economic and policy decisions that Chinese government actors and corporations make. The ambiguity of DSR's branding makes potentially disparate policies across many Chinese companies – each with varying levels of Chinese government involvement – look cohesive. Even within those companies China's hybridized structure of state-owned and private enterprises makes top-level decision-making incentives difficult for outsiders to disentangle.No single company or government entity is totally emblematic of China's DSR, even Huawei. But U.S. 5G operations are still lagging behind that of Asia in the Middle East. The Japan Center for Economic Research predicts that given its performance in light of COVID-19, the Chinese economy will surpass that of the United States before 2030. With rollout of 5G in the U.S. lagging in pace behind that of Asia, Huawei and its peer companies' current moves into Middle Eastern markets could chart a course for Asian dominance in the region's future.Multinational coordination efforts – such as the digital infrastructure partnership launched last year between the EU and Japan – are a positive strategy for the U.S. government's competition to stay relevant on 5G. Republican Chairman of the U.S. Senate's Foreign Relations Committee Jim Risch recently released a report hoping to form a transatlantic partnership between the EU and U.S., citing concerns over the vast capacity for Chinese controlled firms to support data storage. Just like Huawei's 'New Value Together' slogan in the Middle East, cooperation strategies may help the West stay relevant and bring increasingly competitive value to the Middle Eastern ICT market.Sophie Zinser is a researcher focusing on China's role in the Middle East, South and Central Asia.";thediplomat.com;2310;news;ID;en;Sophie Zinser;https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat-2020-12-15-12.jpg;False;;32.88938;afe66583a5b3a536980c52e2ae9a296a;{'q': 'Digital Silk Road AND DSR', 'lang': 'en', 'to_rank': 10000, 'page_size': 100, 'from': '3 years ago', 'sort_by': 'date', 'page': 1}

The US government will also be involved in the risk analysis of some projects and will determine whether some technologies will be transferred to allies or not. Some of the tech sectors that are set to be covered under the new program include advanced sensing, aero-engine technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), communication, and human-machine interfaces. According to a statement issued by the White House, 'The United States will not turn a blind eye to the tactics of countries like China and Russia, which steal technology, coerce companies into handing over intellectual property, undercut free and fair markets, and surreptitiously divert emerging civilian technologies to build up their militaries.' This latest initiative largely targets China. The East Asian nation is considered to be a serious emerging threat to US corporations. Chinese companies currently have an edge over their privately-owned American counterparts because they get preferential access to government funds for research. They also have direct access to a sizeable 1.3 billion population that provides a market ready for their products. Chinese companies have direct access to a sizeable 1.3 billion population that provides a market for their products. Many of the country's most innovative tech companies get substantial government backing. This helps them to dominate foreign markets. The US government sees this as a form of digital colonialism. The companies are supported in their expansionist plans so long as they stick to policies outlined by the Chinese Communist Party. Among the most concerning aspects is the nation's cybersecurity law which came into effect in 2017. It has a clause requiring Chinese companies operating in the nation to store user data in the country. It also imposes data transfer restrictions to foreign entities. This is among the reasons why the US government has been fidgety about TikTok. The viral video app which has taken the social media scene by storm has approximately 100 million US users. Its access to the US market recently became a major inflection point due to its access to personal user data. The problem was escalated to a national security issue. China currently tops the rankings when it comes to the sheer number of patent applications, and this underlines its resolve to become a world technology leader. Over the past year, Chinese companies have made about 58,990 patent applications. In contrast, US firms submitted approximately 57,840 patents. China's endeavor to dominate the tech sector is coordinated via an initiative called the Digital Silk Road (DSR). The project is aimed at extending the nation's digital footprint worldwide. Its main objectives include building vital digital infrastructure, boosting Chinese technology firms, and augmenting access to critical data. Unveiled in 2015 as a largely private-sector program, it has received immense government support in recent years. The White House is looking to inspire a similar homegrown initiative.

Other countries such as Australia and Japan also have effectively banned the company, echoing Washington's fears of a potential national security threat.Unfortunately for those hawkish on Huawei, the vast majority of the world remains open to using the company's technology. Huawei has a presence in more than 170 countries, including dozens in Europe, and even Canada has yet to be persuaded to block the Chinese Communist Party-linked company.This is a reflection of the reality that America finds itself in today — namely, that China appears to be winning the war to build the world's technology infrastructure.China's push to dominate technology is being coordinated through a program called the Digital Silk Road (DSR), a subset of the more widely known Belt and Road Initiative. Launched in 2015, the DSR is a private-sector agenda heavily supported by the state with the aim of extending China's digital presence abroad, and thereby enhancing its commercial and political influence.The DSR is answering the demand for connectivity from Asia to Africa to Latin America. Chinese companies have built out much of the world's digital foundations, including fiber-optic cables and telecommunication network schemes. Data centers have been constructed, and projects set up in smart education and online surveillance. The global pandemic is providing new opportunities for Chinese companies in the fast-growing digital health care sector, with both Huawei and Alibaba sharing their coronavirus detection systems abroad.Beijing is heavily supporting this expansion. Huawei's success has been eased by a state-backed credit line that at one point reached $100 billion and made sure that it was able to outbid all its rivals not only on price, but on R&D too. Billions of dollars of loans have been given to countries to buy Chinese tech in the name of development aid, and such is the DSR's positive impact on global digital infrastructure that the program is now being referenced by the United Nations as a way to advance its own Sustainability Development Goals.On the face of it, American technology firms are doing very well versus their Chinese counterparts. Microsoft and Alphabet, for example, are far more valuable than, say, Alibaba or Tencent. Yet in the race for the world, many American company boards simply don't have the appetite to spend money outside of their core Western and allied markets; Oracle, one of America's tech titans, has just a third of the global presence of Huawei. When American firms do try to invest in emerging market infrastructure, they run the risk of accusations of 'digital colonialism.'Taking a mainly commercial view means that Western companies are being eclipsed by their Chinese rivals across much of the world. This should be a concern for the U.S., given what China wants to do with its tech superiority.Later this year, we expect the release of the 'China Standards 2035' plan, which aims to set global standards for evolving technologies such as the internet of things, artificial intelligence (AI), and 5G over the next 15 years. With Chinese technology infrastructure dominating in so many countries, the 2035 plan will cement China's standards as the norm and give its companies a significant, and perhaps permanent, business advantage over their American competitors.The Chinese capture of advanced technologies is happening. Baidu, which is sometimes called the 'Google of China,' has developed the world's first open source autonomous vehicle platform. It now has 130 partners, including many of the European carmakers.Beijing has aspirations in blockchain, too. It has launched the 'Blockchain Service Network' (BSN), a government-controlled platform that it wants to make dominant not only in China, but worldwide. In the half-year since its announcement, the BSN has established a presence in dozens of countries, including Japan, Australia and the United States.Then there is the internet itself. China has stated plans to replace the technological architecture that has supported the internet for the past half-century with one radically different in form. The design, created by Huawei, calls for a new internet protocol (the so-called 'New IP' proposal) that would allow the internet to be controlled by nation states. Although unlikely to be adopted internationally soon, the proposal is a stark reminder of how technology is not an ethics-neutral domain, but instead is underpinned by subjective values that can be challenged.This is the real issue that Chinese technological control creates. Beijing wants to define the standards of important future technologies such as AI, and the values upon which they are based — a move that will tilt the world away from American commercial and political influence.The world is hungry for more connectivity, and China is satisfying that demand. America needs its own 'Digital Silk Road' equivalent if it is to keep its long-term influence broader than its fellow Huawei hawks.Sam Olsen is the Singapore-based co-founder of the strategic consultancy MetisAsia and a commentator on Chinese-Western relations.
