Ecuador participated Digital Silk Road several ways. worked China smart cities program designed reduce crime. system relies footage four thousand Chinese-made cameras installed throughout country. Following system's installation, cameras likely facial recognition capabilities. addition, several Ecuadorean hospitals begun using artificial intelligence-enabled COVID-19 diagnostic tools developed Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei.NGet briefed story week, developing stories watch across Asia-Pacific.Get Newsletter Although installation surveillance cameras coincided drop crime rates across Ecuador, camera footage, initially thought sent police, also sent country's domestic intelligence agency. past, agency regularly tracked intimidated political opponents. addition, Chinese investment country implicated multiple high-profile corruption cases, well significant debt China. Ecuador sought renegotiate debt Beijing also agreed export 80 percent crude oil China repay debts.AdvertisementIn countries, like Egypt, concerns DSR possibility play role exporting controlled type domestic internet. China courted North Africa Middle East part technology push; reportedly signed Digital Silk Road memoranda understanding Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates. Cooperation moved quickly Egypt. 2019, Egyptian officials visiting China met leaders ten major Chinese firms discuss increasing investment areas including artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, telecommunications infrastructure. Huawei built cloud computing center Egypt, China increasing financing Egypt's telecommunications sector.Egypt desperately needs upgrade crumbling infrastructure gain access inexpensive 5G. Chinese technical assistance could enhance Egyptian government's ability crack internet freedoms. recent years, Beijing held training Egyptian officials censorship; training could provided impetus Egypt adopt 2018 cybercrime law moves country closer China's internet model. law expands government's ability censor online information punish publish even access certain information.Or, DSR could help authoritarian leaders stay power ways. Zambia cooperated Digital Silk Road projects China, particularly upgrades Zambia's wireless networks. Huawei building Zambia's 5G network, many countries across Africa. Huawei also built data center stores processes Zambian government's data. Zambia, democratic success story southern Africa, slides toward authoritarianism, technology cooperation China could empower Zambia's rulers. Huawei reportedly provided technology help Zambian government spy political opponents — situation reportedly repeated Uganda, Huawei helped government monitor political rivals. concerns China's influence Zambia likely suppressed; government President Edgar Lungu also worked censor discourage criticism China Zambian media outlets.Some democracies also worry DSR projects could help Chinese government gain access sensitive data. U.S. officials pressured central east European states use Chinese companies build telecommunications infrastructure, Serbia tried balance U.S. China. Although European countries agreed upon plan limit Huawei's penetration, Serbia welcomed Huawei's assistance upgrading digital infrastructure.Both U.S. government European states worry Chinese government could obtain backdoor access data Huawei networks Serbia. secret backdoor Chinese intelligence, possibly Chinese military, would especially concerning European states; Serbia close links EU. Probably assuage U.S., Serbian government committed Washington prohibit use 'untrusted' 5G providers, White House surely intends mean Huawei. Yet Serbian government given indication actually intends ban Huawei 5G network.Forging DSR existing Digital Silk Road deals start.

China's adopted state-directed strategy influence international standards setting, use foreign policy tool enhance global standing. Xi administration employed dual-track approach setting international technology standards. one hand, seeks influence multilateral (governmental) multi-stakeholder technical Standards Setting Organisations (SSOs) placing Chinese nationals senior leadership positions larger representation Chinese tech companies, hand, Chinese companies, guidance Party-State, creating standards utilizing BRI Digital Silk Road (DSR). International Telecommunications Union (ITU), China second US number entities registered ITU members. involvement Chinese commercial entities ITU increased thanks impetus provided ITU's current Secretary-General, Zhao Houlin served two terms Director ITU's Telecommunication Standardization Bureau (STB). 2021 alone, Chinese entities backed 145 new standards ITU, 46 2015 six times Western entities. number Chinese nationals secretariat leadership positions critical multi-stakeholder SSOs International Organization Standardization (ISO) International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) surged past decade. Chinese Yinbiao Shu heads IEC, industry association publishes international standards electrical, electronic related technologies, also Chairman China Huaneng Group. ISO, Zhang Xiaogang China served ISO President 2015 2018. Beyond IEC, ISO, ITU, Chinese actors also active SSOs. example, China largest number individual members within 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), develops 5G technical specifications. Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Chinese actors active submitting documents (surpassed US representatives). Companies Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei, Tencent ZTE advanced members Institute Electrical Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standards Association. Chinese firms ‘flood' committees huge volume standards proposals, also typically vote single bloc. Beijing also tendency use debt trade leverage influence votes number countries favor proposals. produces strikingly high rate success number Chinese submissions ITU. Many times, proposals put forward Chinese entities attack existing concepts promote Chinese prerogative. example, 2020, Huawei, along China Unicom, China Telecom Chinese Ministry Industry Information Technology (MIIT), proposed new standard core network technology, called ‘New IP' contending existing internet infrastructure unstable vastly insufficient meet requirements digital world. Another emerging facet China's approach technology standards setting Digital Silk Road (DSR) one primary vehicles delivering Chinese technology BRI partner states. signing agreements BRI partner governments, Beijing propagating technology standards project host states, creating dependencies lock countries using Chinese vendors standards. light above, apparent Beijing's moves aimed setting global standards next-generation technologies. wants gain control key technologies like Internet Things, Cloud Computing, Big Data, 5G artificial intelligence.

One China's top initiatives promote innovation digital sector international Digital Silk Road (DSR), component Belt Road Initiative. DSR, China expand foreign markets, secure access foreign suppliers consumers, establish technological standards information communications technology. successful, DSR provide demand steady economic innovation China needs. Yet DSR promise innovation contingent China's success hardware. Although country facing competition abroad, formidable obstacles Chinese economic innovation domestic. China became leader 5G technology, level innovation lags different sector. China's primary innovation challenge lack indigenous capabilities high-value digital hardware, particularly semiconductor logic chips. 2010-2020, China attempted consolidate semiconductor industry, encourage domestic semiconductor companies share research development, foreigners reduce export controls, gain human capital high skills foreign countries. early 2022, however, China still design fabricate substantial number highest-value semiconductor logic chips (Chinese market share less 1 percent Chinese share global market less 6 percent). part problem. two highest value semiconductor logic chips central processing units (CPU) graphics processing units (GPU). George Calhoun noted, categories, Chinese-produced chips lower-quality uncompetitive, even China. China chronically behind semiconductor logic design, fabs, foundries? country simply require time, different set strategies needed? answer questions, assessment China's primary challenges semiconductor design production needed. immediate issues China faces semiconductor industry competitiveness quality. Although China required technical capabilities, enough them. Consider Zhaoxin, Chinese semiconductor company. Chinese company produce x86 CPUs (arguably top-performing CPU), supplies semiconductor design electronics companies Lenovo Hewlett-Packard. Huawei Tsinghua Unigroup subsidiary producing semiconductor logic chips, license core intellectual property British company. 'Despite one world's top five semiconductor foundries world,' wrote Zen Soo Meng Jing, China's 'SMIC [Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation] began produce 14nm semiconductors year. makes three generations – least six years – behind rivals.' Generally speaking, China designs memory chips, easier produce logic chips, leader semiconductor assembly packaging. Thus, China making progress design semiconductor logic chips, still largely produces lower-quality semiconductors. government's 'Made China 2025' strategy intends supply 70 percent China's semiconductor demand indigenous design production, unclear goal achieved plan's deadline. current state, Chinese semiconductor companies cannot meet Chinese demand semiconductors, much less global demand. means Chinese manufacturers remain heavily reliant high-quality semiconductors produced overseas. According January 2021 report Georgetown University's Center Security Emerging Technology semiconductor supply chain, U.S. semiconductor industry contributes 39 percent total value global semiconductor supply chain. U.S.-allied nations regions—Japan, Europe (especially Netherlands, United Kingdom, Germany), Taiwan, South Korea—collectively contribute another 53 percent. Together, countries regions enjoy competitive advantage virtually every supply chain segment. China's market share quality low? rivals latest technology. China not. declared high-end semiconductors strategic industry early 2000s, Chinese government understands developing capabilities sector decades-long process. education, long-term battle won, China behind. According Hongbin Li, et al.'s article 'Human Capital China's Future Growth' Journal Economic Perspectives, United States, 90 percent labor force composed high school graduates; college graduates make 45 percent (as 2015). China, college graduates high school graduates made 12.5 percent 28.8 percent, respectively, workforce. China's high school college graduate numbers lower Mexico, South Africa, Philippines, Malaysia. Although China's level innovation high compared developing countries, China cannot effectively compete developed countries low education rates. Lastly, unclear whether Chinese government's investment worth return. Even United States' recent effort bring semiconductor manufacturing back home, incentives Chinese semiconductor companies dwarf offered America. Analyst Peter Cowhey puts way: …the outsized Chinese government support semiconductor industry becomes even starkly apparent comparing value total funding assistance percentage nations'/regions' value global semiconductor sales. measure, China's government assistance semiconductor industry equivalent 137 percent Chinese semiconductor industry's global sales, compared 11 percent Japan, 3.8 percent Taiwan, 2.3 percent European Union, miniscule 0.01 percent South Korea United States.

China's heavy investment Middle East recent years, including BRI, thus particular concern Washington. Reviewing efforts fared past decade may yield interesting insights. BRI Matters Middle East BRI primarily series projects (comprising traditional physical digital infrastructure) designed connect integrate cooperating partners—cities, markets, countries—across regions.

First, seeks recognized great power status domestically states. Middle East strategically important region, China's engagement seen way increase influence stake global order. Second, aimed secure economic interests region BRI framework continued access energy resources heavily dependent . BRI thus means China increase channels exporting goods, reduce trade friction, improve access natural resources, build supply chains, generate opportunities Chinese companies invest overseas sell goods services. end, past ten years, integrated BRI framework Middle East countries' national development strategies. BRI long-term initiative continue evolve coming years, Beijing need carefully assess success impact projects Middle East make informed decisions proceed. success framework Middle East depends several factors, including economic political stability region, quality BRI projects, willingness host countries cooperate China. importantly, BRI projects essential underdeveloped Middle East states dependent external creditors establish critical physical digital infrastructures. projects already operation entering second third phases development. Unless alternative creditors support development, countries Middle East continue depend work China. Assessing BRI Projects Middle East Currently, BRI projects span fifteen Middle East nations include major infrastructural digital projects land sea. status projects varies, planned, ongoing, completed, halted, canceled, providing insight present overall situation BRI. Developing deeper understanding challenging, however, due 1) deliberate opacity surrounding BRI projects Chinese host regional countries' sides 2) sheer scale initiative, spans large swathes continents. lack transparency major challenge researchers policymakers trying understand BRI implications. Nonetheless, still great amount information available consider. International Institute Strategic Studies (IISS) China Connects database , example, provides valuable overview China's BRI investment lending Middle East. database also includes information Digital Silk Road (DSR) investments, understood BRI's technological component—a digital bridge-building project intended promote new type globalization via digital trade, digital infrastructure, cross-border e-commerce, mobile financial tools, Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies (big data, digital currencies, cloud computing, on). case, IISS China Connects data demonstrates China investing heavily Middle East, 266 BRI projects 2005 2022 (see Table 1). either ongoing completed, projects canceled halted (see Table 2). positive sign China, showing initiative gaining traction region. note funded. data shows China investing heavily digital infrastructure region, likely continue coming years Beijing seeks expand global reach.

Consequently, China announced three new initiatives 2021-22 and, although still rather vague, directed gaining greater influence Global South, accelerating perception US decline, promoting China\\'s warped perspective international order.

China world\\'s largest private lender, yet nearly 60 per cent Chinese overseas loanstoday held countries considered financially distressed. put context, 2010 figure 5 per cent. China\\'s BRI plight magnified COVID-19 Ukraine war. Indeed, Russia, Belarus Ukraine accounted 20 per cent China\\'s overseas lending past two decades. China\\'s lending boom truly ended, plus struggling countries like Pakistan asking debt restructuring. BRI peaked 2018, five years ago. Although China globally pushing take security, development digital governance, China also, certain extent turning focus inwards, returning centuries-old practice retreating within borders. China\\'s narrative BRI would increase connectivity infrastructure. Indeed, China listed five priorities: coordinating policy; improving connectivity; reducing impediments trade; integrating financial structures; building people-to-people ties exchanges/dialogues. However, rapidly morphed hydra absolutely overseas project subsumed umbrella. Around 2016, Chinese investment rail, road, port pipeline projects boomed, China\\'s economic woes slowed efforts since 2018/19. also noticeable trend hard infrastructure projects towards digital infrastructure ones. Indeed, BRI\\'s future seems rest Digital Silk Road (DSR), launched 2015. another tangent, \"Health Silk Road\" projects intensified 2020 China exported COVID-19 vaccines medical supplies. Initially, BRI investment directed towards Central Asia Southeast Asia, spreading westward Africa. Since 2018, Latin America South Pacific received lot attention. However, South Asia Southeast Asia ultimately emerged main foci. Earlier month, International Institute Strategic Studies (IISS) issued annual Asia-Pacific Regional Security Assessment. Meia Nouwens, Senior Fellow Chinese Security Defense Policy IISS, contributed chapter entitled China\\'s Belt Road Initiative Decade on. Nouwens discussed implications four key regions. Beginning Southeast Asia, said region remain Beijing\\'s chief area strategic importance. China ASEAN\\'s largest trading partner since 2009, bloc China\\'s largest trading partner since 2020. Maritime routes run Southeast Asian chokepoints too, encouraging China push railways alternative. Key recipients Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Philippines Vietnam. Naturally, China wants Southeast Asia non-aligned, serve bulwark American influence. However, China favours continual harassment Philippine Vietnamese commercial law enforcement activities South China Sea. Western countries leery adopting Chinese 5G telecommunication networks, case many developing countries. Nonetheless, China exerts tighter control domestic private-sector technology companies, complicate ability execute projects overseas. USA\\'s stricter regulation semiconductor microchip technologies also complicate China\\'s ambitions. According Nouwens, fear economic dependency, ethnic tensions, project build quality corporate social responsibility remain troubling issues China. Ethnic tensions often result beliefs Chinese-led projects benefit migrant workers rather local population. Indonesia, instance, Chinese guest workers rose 17,515 2015 30,000 2018. Considering South Asia region, unsurprisingly Pakistan received lion\\'s share BRI investment, absorbing half money. China\\'s heavy investment road, rail pipeline infrastructure Himalayas part China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) paying economic dividends, however. Indeed, far expensive transport products overland Pakistan traditional sea routes. instance, shifting 200,000 barrels crude oil per day via Burma-China pipeline, 250,000 barrels daily Pakistan-China pipeline, China would lose approximately USD1 billion per year compared traditional seaborne tanker route. Another estimate predicts shipping oil Persian Gulf China\\'s east coast would cost USD2 per barrel, whereas would cost USD15 per barrel via Pakistan overland pipeline. Nouwens commented, \"The BRI South Asia achieved intended goal ofexporting Chinese industrial overcapacity abroad. 2010-18, example, value Chinese industrial goods exports Pakistan increased USD3.1 billion USD8.2 billion. Nevertheless, South Asian BRI projects faced security, political, economic, geographic governance challenges.\" Furthermore, \"Chinese investments region necessarily created favourable conditions Beijing\\'s influence. Chinese investment South Asia one factor encouraging India align closely West, notably Quad.\" Central Asia, boosting ties helping China develop poorer western provinces. 2016-21, annual China-Europe freight train journeys snowballed 1,702 15,183. Nonetheless, trade China Europe still travels sea (95+ per cent Germany\\'s case), Ukraine war led 34 per cent drop volume via northern rail corridor. South Pacific region, Australia, New Zealand USA concerned Chinese interests encroaching, especially since 2018 uptick. One example last year\\'s Solomon Islands-China security agreement.

Perhaps Xi know either, even consensus name - originally labelled Silk Road Economic Belt 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, One Belt, One Road. BRI became blue-ribbon project Xi. Thus, and, extension, China\\'s prestige became dependent success. Now, ten years on, China tighten belt divert road new directions keep whole concept alive. Consequently, China announced three new initiatives 2021-22 and, although still rather vague, directed gaining greater influence Global South, accelerating perception US decline, promoting China\\'s warped perspective international order. Xi promotes twisted form obstreperous China-centric security designed usurp West, Asia-Pacific region especially increasingly become battleground ideologies. China world\\'s largest private lender, yet nearly 60 per cent Chinese overseas loanstoday held countries considered financially distressed. put context, 2010 figure 5 per cent. China\\'s BRI plight magnified COVID-19 Ukraine war. Indeed, Russia, Belarus Ukraine accounted 20 per cent China\\'s overseas lending past two decades. China\\'s lending boom truly ended, plus struggling countries like Pakistan asking debt restructuring. BRI peaked 2018, five years ago. Although China globally pushing take security, development digital governance, China also, certain extent turning focus inwards, returning centuries-old practice retreating within borders. China\\'s narrative BRI would increase connectivity infrastructure. Indeed, China listed five priorities: coordinating policy; improving connectivity; reducing impediments trade; integrating financial structures; building people-to-people ties exchanges/dialogues. However, rapidly morphed hydra absolutely overseas project subsumed umbrella. Around 2016, Chinese investment rail, road, port pipeline projects boomed, China\\'s economic woes slowed efforts since 2018/19. also noticeable trend hard infrastructure projects towards digital infrastructure ones. Indeed, BRI\\'s future seems rest Digital Silk Road (DSR), launched 2015. another tangent, \"Health Silk Road\" projects intensified 2020 China exported COVID-19 vaccines medical supplies. Initially, BRI investment directed towards Central Asia Southeast Asia, spreading westward Africa. Since 2018, Latin America South Pacific received lot attention. However, South Asia Southeast Asia ultimately emerged main foci. Earlier month, International Institute Strategic Studies (IISS) issued annual Asia-Pacific Regional Security Assessment. Meia Nouwens, Senior Fellow Chinese Security Defense Policy IISS, contributed chapter entitled China\\'s Belt Road Initiative Decade on. Nouwens discussed implications four key regions. Beginning Southeast Asia, said region remain Beijing\\'s chief area strategic importance. China ASEAN\\'s largest trading partner since 2009, bloc China\\'s largest trading partner since 2020. Maritime routes run Southeast Asian chokepoints too, encouraging China push railways alternative. Key recipients Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Philippines Vietnam. Naturally, China wants Southeast Asia non-aligned, serve bulwark American influence. However, China favours continual harassment Philippine Vietnamese commercial law enforcement activities South China Sea. Western countries leery adopting Chinese 5G telecommunication networks, case many developing countries. Nonetheless, China exerts tighter control domestic private-sector technology companies, complicate ability execute projects overseas. USA\\'s stricter regulation semiconductor microchip technologies also complicate China\\'s ambitions. According Nouwens, fear economic dependency, ethnic tensions, project build quality corporate social responsibility remain troubling issues China. Ethnic tensions often result beliefs Chinese-led projects benefit migrant workers rather local population. Indonesia, instance, Chinese guest workers rose 17,515 2015 30,000 2018. Considering South Asia region, unsurprisingly Pakistan received lion\\'s share BRI investment, absorbing half money. China\\'s heavy investment road, rail pipeline infrastructure Himalayas part China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) paying economic dividends, however. Indeed, far expensive transport products overland Pakistan traditional sea routes. instance, shifting 200,000 barrels crude oil per day via Burma-China pipeline, 250,000 barrels daily Pakistan-China pipeline, China would lose approximately USD1 billion per year compared traditional seaborne tanker route. Another estimate predicts shipping oil Persian Gulf China\\'s east coast would cost USD2 per barrel, whereas would cost USD15 per barrel via Pakistan overland pipeline. Nouwens commented, \"The BRI South Asia achieved intended goal ofexporting Chinese industrial overcapacity abroad. 2010-18, example, value Chinese industrial goods exports Pakistan increased USD3.1 billion USD8.2 billion.

       " \"overarching belief India Prime Minister Narendra Modi, country emerged global balancer amidst ‘great changes unseen century' – Chinese President Xi Jinping calls reshaping twin global geopolitical economic orders. reality, however, India headed towards strategic isolation irrelevance neighbourhood 2030. two strategic tech-centric decisions taken recent Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) leaders' meeting held margins G-7 summit Japan. first decision collaborate US-led drive telecommunications including 5G 6G, developing ‘standards' critical emerging technologies, especially Artificial Intelligence (AI), cybersecurity. ‘Standards' technology relate commonality hardware, software, platforms interoperability work together. Different tech standards disrupt global supply chain force global companies develop two sets technologies: one meet US developed nations' standards Global North, another Chinese standards supported Russia joined Belt Road Initiative (BRI), Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), BRICS and, generally, major section Global South. Ironically, India – part Quad BRICS/SCO – caught riding two horses. Consequently, Global North consumer nations – especially US European Union (EU) also Japan Australia – face compatibility problems technology development front. thus become increasingly difficult US EU continue present policy ‘de-risk' China – pragmatic version impulse ‘de-couple' . ‘De-risk' refers China's exclusion select technologies like advanced chips, ‘de-couple' means end trade commerce. Moreover, China primary trading partner 138 nations, digital logistics systems built Chinese tech make traditional trade commerce nations following US digital trade standards difficult or, least expensive. Second, part ‘partnership cable connectivity resilience', Quad leverage expertise design, manufacturing, laying maintenance subsea cables secure diversify critical networks. result 'splinternet': separation global internet two sets subsea cables developed maintained, respectively, US China. Together, two Quad decisions – tacitly endorsed G-7 nations – fragment globalisation 2030 far free flow data, trade, capital, human resources concerned, adversely impact third fourth industrial revolutions – concerned mobile internet economy (hardware digital connectivity cyberspace) industrial internet economy (software digital connectivity cyberspace). core Quad decisions cross-border governance debate two issues: cybersecurity cyberspace governance, rules regarding control data, properly handled, enhance nation's innovation power. Meanwhile, China's Digital Silk Road (DSR) announced Xi Jinping 2017 part Belt Road (BRI)'s second phase. Since DSR hardware software cyberspace connectivity, encapsulates third fourth industrial revolutions (or robotics age), hence shift global geopolitical balance power. China's hardware cyberspace connectivity comprises subsea cables, fibre optic cables. BeiDou Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) – which, total 35 satellites, surpassed US's Global Positioning System completed 2020 – commonly referred Space Silk Road. help monitoring BRI.

US dynamic structure comparable DSR offers prosperity nations advanced information technology broadband networks, e-commerce hubs, smart cities, efficient ways business on. Obama's pivot towards Asia-Pacific region discussing India South Asia, let's understand genesis tech war two big tech giants. Conscious China's rise, shifted global geopolitics geoeconomics Europe Asia-Pacific region, Obama administration 2011 announced ‘rebalancing' strategy aimed Beijing. ‘pivot' two components: Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), huge trade investment agreement 12 Pacific rim nations, military repositioning, aimed shifting 60% US naval assets Pacific Command (PACOM) Hawaii meet growing challenge People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy (PLAN). China's delight, Trump administration withdrew TPP upon entering office 2017. instead focused deterrence (military power) renamed Asia Pacific Indo-Pacific. PACOM became Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) give centrality India's role US-led deterrence system. left field open China economic cooperation Asia-Pacific nations. Trump administration's Sputnik Moment came China, July 2017, released super ambitious ‘New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan' become global leader AI 2030. Since emerging technologies converge AI, dual use ushering prosperity fourth industrial revolution changing character war. Thus, progress management AI ecosystems main issue determining global polarity. remains seen whether world remains multipolar – since longer unipolar – moves towards bipolarity end decade, progress AI ecosystems major powers becomes clear. new bipolarity will, course, vastly different Cold War years since would Iron Curtain fragmented globalisation led US China. again, contours unipolarity could emerge second half century. China's 20/30 vision Interestingly, Trump administration failed comprehend Sputnik Moment China come turn century itself, Chinese started using smartphones mass level. Unlike rest world, China moved directly cash payment norm mobile payment without developed credit card system. 2013, 900 million Chinese using mobile internet (smartphones connected 4G wireless internet), population US Europe combined. Thus, 2017, China announced AI plans, mobile internet companies unrivalled consumer data pool made easy convert mobile internet consumers (third industrial revolution) industrial internet enterprises (fourth industrial revolution). Alongside, China's foray international cyberspace connectivity started 2009 junior partner joint venture subsea cables UK-based Global Marine . 2019, China's Huawei Marine Networks completed one hundred projects involving shorter longer trans-Atlantic distances using indigenous advanced subsea cables Chinese acquired expertise laying them. China became fourth largest supplier subsea cables world required assistance foreign partners. Xi Jinping announced Digital Silk Road , worldwide demand subsea cables greater bandwidth increased. China among nations making advances material sciences, optics, data processing enable higher capability submarine-grade fibre. conscious investing heavily advanced subsea cables, terrestrial fibre optic cables, standalone infrastructure Huawei 5G wireless network would allow data flow greater speed, higher volumes, minimal latency compared existing 4G networks. Unlike US, subsea cables private sector, Chinese government backing strategic cyber connectivity plans policies, timelines, resources, subsidies, loans. Since subsea cables carry 95% international data, demand data increased exponentially, high-speed internet expected spur innovation, increase employment opportunities, exploit 5G potential, prepare world 6G connectivity expected commercialised 2030. Four things China got right Starting 2017, China took four important steps left US wondering left behind fourth industrial revolution. One, ushered industrial internet converting internet companies technology companies also helped launch start-ups. optimise digital technologies, Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent among others started cloud services users rent remotely access range computing services including servers, data storage, network, analytics, databases. Realising data strategic resource, Chinese built industrial data centres manufacturing producing data help capabilities traditional industries. Two, Xi, October 2019, attested blockchain technology important breakthrough next round technological innovation industrial transformation. Blockchain distributed digital ledger open anyone join. name suggests, number connected blocks, block three items: data, hash (like fingerprint, unique block), hash previous block. data added deleted block digital ledger, changes get automatically made blocks chain hash also registers it. many checks system, tampering data becomes impossible. makes transactions quick, convenient, controlled, traceable, secure, stable since people chain get know changes made block. 2020, China launched Blockchain Services Network (BSN) , overarching framework wherein various blockchains different services brought one framework digital monitoring. Three, China launched world's first Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), e-Yuan e-Renminbi April 2020 . Digital renminbi world's first digital currency issued country's central bank, case cryptocurrency. Unlike digital wallet system Alipay WeChat, digital renminbi representation actual amount bank, digital wallet. China, thus, created new monetary transfer pathway independent existing ones dominated US like SWIFT system. So, face it, reserve currency (usually US dollars) affected alternate Chinese money transfer system. BRI nations find Chinese payment system faster, cheaper, efficient, importance systems like SWIFT diminish. Eventually, BRI countries business China realise e-Renminbi China's central bank issued currency also ticket China's new digital payment system would supported secure transparent BSN. example, customer BRI nation buys physical containers China, needs make payment digital renminbi. Everything else, customs clearance shipment exact delivery date happen automatically able trace monitor progress. Lastly, China announced dual circulation policy September 2020 . two aspects. first strengthen domestic economy supply chain structural reforms distribution wealth aim bring Chinese people middle class. involved medium companies working digital industrial economy rather big corporations like Alibaba, Weibo, Didi Chuxing technologies. second aspect dual circulation policy foreign investments, free trade agreements, free trade ports engagement outside world encouraged actively sought. dual circulation policy came global criticism—that Communist party want power centres shape huge Chinese corporations. may entirely untrue, point policy sharpen Chinese fourth industrial revolution home sold BRI nations.

Beijing's grand design, Middle East plays indispensable role. Western analysts often misjudged China's interests region purely commercial. Xi values region economic potential, sees one important arenas competition United States. Yet United States National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan recently discussed American leadership global economy, focused Europe Indo-Pacific mentioned Africa Latin America. mention Middle East once. 1 Washington's persistent blind spot Middle East obscured view Beijing's global ambitions. US rectify mistake, risks losing influence region aiding China's effort supplant US atop global economic order. Appeal Middle East Xi faces multiple hard facts endeavors construct Beijing-led economic bloc. US allies continue dominate key sectors global economy, finance high-tech industries like robotics, aeronautics, semiconductors, closed-circuit chips. Additionally, US dollar remains international reserve currency. Moreover, China lacks domestic reserves oil. disadvantage puts hard ceiling potential Chinese manufacturing. Beijing currently relies Iranian Russian oil, discounted due American economic sanctions. maintaining strong strategic ties Middle Eastern oil producers, West retain leverage prospective Sinocentric bloc region. Yet Xi wants China manufacturing hub. seeks take lead high-tech sectors help Beijing establish new international standards, create alternative global financial system, achieve self-sufficiency strategic industries. Hudson's John Lee demonstrated, China's dependence Western technology makes economically vulnerable. Beijing launched multiple initiatives mitigate vulnerability making West reliant Chinese technology manufacturing inputs. 2 Middle East holds potential facilitate Xi's hegemonic ambitions. Middle Eastern states possess substantial capital reserves invest either China countries partnerships China facilitates. China, meanwhile, would benefit using Middle East market high-tech products depend region energy source decades come. Gulf countries, become disenchanted US, welcomed Beijing's efforts tighten relations. factors render region uniquely attractive Beijing seeks overcome economic challenges. Belt Road Rescue Launched 2013, Xi's ambitious Belt Road Initiative (BRI) aims lay groundwork Sinocentric economic bloc extensive infrastructure projects abroad. BRI wide-ranging initiative, comprising Silk Road Economic Belt Twenty-first Century Maritime Silk Road. total investments nearing $1 trillion, BRI seeks strengthen China's economic growth, promote Chinese exports, expand reach state-owned enterprises (SOEs), secure Beijing's control key commodities. 3 Despite initial promise, many China's BRI partners longer view initiative favorably. even acquired skeptics within CCP. Persistent corruption low construction standards created substandard infrastructure trapped several BRI participant countries debt crises. 4 Sri Lanka instructive example. BRI's crown jewel, China made significant investments high-profile infrastructure projects, including deep-water port Hambantota. Trapped unmanageable debt load, Sri Lanka spiraled severe economic crisis. Essential supplies like food, fuel, medicine became scarce. 2017, China took Hambantota port 99-year lease, giving China valuable position monitor Indian Ocean shipping routes. Sri Lanka sought restructure debt facilitate $3 billion International Monetary Fund bailout, China, Sri Lanka's primary lender, took uncompromising position prolonged negotiations. 5 end 2022, Colombo owed Chinese lenders $7.4 billion, nearly one-fifth Sri Lanka's public debt. 6 Detractors claim cases like Sri Lanka's inevitable consequence Chinese approach international development projects. Unlike American model, uses official government aid, China relied heavily capital sourced development banks state-run commercial lenders. 7 Beijing's behest, institutions sometimes offer below-market interest rates borrowers would otherwise struggle secure funding. result, Chinese institutions underperformed compared global peers. 8 model delivered Beijing strategic benefits, also become headache. Beijing faces scarcity investment capital, China's rapid economic growth extensive borrowing recent decades put risk potential debt crisis. reflected China's high debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio, reached record 279.7 percent first quarter year. 9 Local governments' hidden debt poses challenge Xi. Years debt accumulated infrastructure projects expenses, costs Xi's zero-COVID campaign, government's crackdown property market leverage strained local government finances. 10 CCP claims local governments officially owe around $5.1 trillion. actual amount likely much higher. Chinese property market major driver country's GDP growth. suffered since government implemented measures curb excessive borrowing speculative activity 2021. Private developers face overwhelming debts cannot repay. China's second-largest property developer, Evergrande, defaulted late 2021. Chinese banks' balance sheets bear combined burden debt obligations local governments decreased value property market loans. analysts believe Chinese financial system unlikely melt down, debt crisis remains significant drag economic growth. led job losses, spending cuts local government level, reduced investments domestic international infrastructure. 11 Chinese government works determine country's long-term economic trajectory, manage debt levels deleverage investments ensure financial stability. onerous economic environment explains Beijing taken interest Middle East.

       " \"China's growing technological expertise along digital silk road expected set benchmarks rest world follow, according analysts.President Xi's ambitious Belt Road Initiative (BRI) started digital silk road long rest world began talking connected smart cities technology driven solutions.As China continues expand digital footprint sectors diverse cloud computing, 5G, surveillance technology virtual currency, observers see movement areas toward Chinese technological dominance.Dale Aluf, Director Research & Strategy SIGNAL (Sino-Israel Global Network & Academic Leadership) said China already leading world artificial intelligence, blockchain, 5G, quantum technology publications patents. 'Data fuels AI development and, thanks sprawling surveillance apparatus, China access immense amounts it, China seems well-positioned emerge leader field.'China already launched biggest blockchain ecosystem world, connected 100 city nodes, first country launch widespread pilots digital fiat currency - Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) system.Analysts agree China achieved enormous breakthroughs future technologies.'These advancements technologies allow China efficiently promote progress BRI, increase bonding China BRI countries, push BRI's hard projects,' said Walter Wang, Consulting Director research consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, Greater China.Wang cited China's world-leading fibre optic industry, already assisting BRI countries transforming traditional renewable energy supplies.Many countries aligned BRI rich solar energy resources, 'lack technologies resources construct renewable energy infrastructure,' according Wang.'Through BRI, China export advanced renewable energy technologies BRI countries Chinese fibre optic enterprises able enjoy local preferential policies, including tax incentives, preferential treatment equipment imports,' added. According Frost & Sullivan research, infrastructure areas, high-speed railway, 5G networks, ultra-high voltage power grids, China's standards become international standards everyone else plays catch-up.'Therefore, collaborating Chinese enterprises, BRI partner countries adopt technologies accord advanced standards infrastructure projects,' said Wang.Impact BRIAccording SIGNAL's Aluf, China's technological prowess gives edge push BRI's hard projects, renewable energy, transportation, infrastructure, power, healthcare since today's technology-driven world, digital realm intimately intertwined hard infrastructure.'Railways, ports, electricity grids, instance, would able operate effectively today without software, sensors, cybersecurity,' notedMoreover, China also provides useful reference BRI countries digital transformation industrial digitalisation models.Wang said BRI countries developing countries limited experience dealing digital technology benefit China's digitalisation experiences.He gave example Silk Road E-commerce platform China developed together 22 BRI countries 2016. COVID-19 pandemic, China, aligned BRI, quickly adjusted strategies, switching focus offline online market, exploiting advantages cross-border e-commerce platforms, creating new growth points economic development BRI countries.In future, Wang expects China continue assisting BRI countries improve 5G infrastructure, foundation future digital transformation, promote digital economies, popularising mobile payments facilitate loan processes SMBs therefore alleviate 'urgent need' financing pandemic.How technology incorporated BRI projects depend much nature projects, according Jia Hao Chan, research associate Lee Kuan Yew School Public Policy, National University Singapore.'And differ among regions countries,' said.For instance, late 2017, Chinese company Huawei Marine partnered Pakistani authorities start constructing Pakistan East Africa Cable Express, connect Pakistan Kenya Djibouti, focusing hard infrastructure interconnectivity.'This essentially different areas China looking Southeast Asia (focusing services, soft infrastructure), tech companies like Alibaba Didi Chuxing would collaborate regional ride-hailing services like Grab, investment partnerships.' TECHNOLOGY EXPORTSGiven BRI primarily financing/investment mechanism, analysts Fitch Solutions believe exporting technology simply adds different dimension entire BRI assistance package.'Broadly speaking, BRI projects already dependent using Chinese equipment labour, kind tech advancement might mean higher quality efficient projects,' said Daine Loh, Analyst, Infrastructure Power & Renewables, Fitch Solutions.She pointed things like 5G AI still early adoption stage broader infrastructure sector, adding, 'we expect widely used yet'.Loh said anything digital tend also require larger investment amount, 'the financial capacity BRI recipient markets come question well, especially markets prioritising developing adequate infrastructure meet domestic needs first'.The best way BRI partner countries benefit China's technological prowess partner Chinese operators, according Chris Devonshire Ellis, Chairman Dezan Shira & Associates.'In West, capitalist system focused much profits enough cashflow business service lines. Chinese developing technologies hook services supply chains generate cash flow streams. sustainable business model,' said.LIMITS SHARINGWhile China achieved digital supremacy areas future tech, much shared BRI partner countries remains seen. developing countries able take advantage ICT infrastructure, China 'will share ownership technology drives infrastructure,' according Andre Wheeler.'The technology owned China National Security legislative provisions. may act barrier future trade developing countries may restricted conduct trade likes EU,' said Wheeler, also chief executive Asia Pacific Connex.The Digital Silk Road, BRI supply-driven project, noted researcher Chan. added China's technological offers guarantee level adoption (demand) tech goods services across partner countries.'Moreover, could lag effect tech exports, certain technologies gain foothold Chinese market deployed elsewhere.'Hence, Chan suggested BRI partner countries carefully consider 'what really need' merely 'take whatever put table'. 'They also consider ability adopt technologies want, rate innovation going attain competitive advantage long run.'According Wheeler, digital silk road integrator trade along BRI – something developed create integrated seamless trade platform BRI participants.'It powerful targets key merge points transport systems, particularly ports rail.'However, points shortcomings DSR/BRI integration could limit China BRI partner countries regional role.Whilst EU–China Comprehensive Agreement Investment (CAI) agreement principle heralded January means cooperation, Wheeler said also significant pushback EU, regards recently introduced EU-Connectivity strategy led likes Huawei banned network provider EU digital connectivity initiatives.MAKING INROADSBut many countries already enjoying benefits China's augmentation infrastructure tech.Aluf SIGNAL pointed several Middle Eastern countries cooperating China smart city technology, even project designed streamline experiences pilgrims travelling Mecca Medina.'China's 2Africa initiative, among largest subsea projects world, aims connect 23 countries Africa, Middle East Europe resource-efficient fibre optic cable uses Spatial Division Multiplexing technology,' added.Meanwhile, SeaMeWe-5 undersea cable expected carry telecommunications Singapore France.According Frost & Sullivan's Wang, BRI partner countries outdated data infrastructure, means operational efficiency low maintenance costs relatively expensive.For long-term development, countries need upgrade existing infrastructure well initiate new infrastructure projects.'China, pioneer, provide countries necessary technologies, financing and, importantly, practical experiences,' said Wang.For example, said, China Republic Belarus jointly built industrial parks based industrial Internet. China also transportation internet infrastructure upgrading projects Iran, Pakistan, Vietnam, Brazil, Malaysia. 'Thus, support China, BRI partner countries accelerate infrastructure upgrading process build information systems,' added Wang.BEYOND TECH SUPREMACY China's dominance future technologies continue grow one overlooked aspect BRI, according Ellis, turn China global supply chain middleman.'It making products building infrastructure, operate much it. 'Everything someone buys Paris London price component charged Chinese business,' said.While seems tendency observers focus specific technologies impacts given tech economic sector, Aluf insists true power technologies unleashed augmentation.For example, combining embedded sensors, metering devices, cameras, surveillance tech big data processing aggregated data analysis, said China emerged forefront smart city development. 'The said fintech sector, companies like Huawei, Tencent, Alibaba leading way.'With China doubling achieving carbon neutrality, Aluf said also expected pump significant resources development clean technologies renewable energy.FUTURE INVESTMENTS terms investment BRI, China likely increase funding soft infrastructure Digital Silk Route said necessarily form intergovernmental (G2G), government-to-business (G2B) industry-wide coordinated approach.

IntroductionAs new type trade, digital trade become important focus promoting China's opening economic progress. development Maritime Silk Road plays vital role strengthening international regional economic cooperation [1]. Therefore, exploring trade competition trade potential China countries along Maritime Silk Road momentous practical significance promoting China's economic growth regional economic cooperation among countries along route [2]. process sailing sea, ship faces complex changeable marine environment. properly scheduling ship network realizing manipulation overall control system stable sailing ship ensured [3]. time, affected digital trade barriers, certain obstacles global trade. Research reducing obstacles improving ship network scheduling plays significant role development international trade construction [4].At present, scholars made studies maritime transportation network scheduling. Yang et al. [5] conducted detailed study resource management scheduling maritime networks using deep learning (DL) algorithm combined optimal link selection scheme Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) [5]. Zhang et al. [6–8] proposed new intelligent effective method based improved Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) solve optimization problem path multiobjective ships [6]. Shang et al. [9] proposed DL-based energy optimization scheduling method ship power systems, simulation experiments, effectiveness superiority optimal scheduling method verified [9]. Peng et al. [10] studied coordination dispatch emergency materials according characteristics emergencies sea, constructing maritime emergency material dispatching architecture including three layers onshore supply layer, assembly layer, accident layer two processes onshore transportation maritime maneuver rescue [10]. application genetic algorithm (GA), Wang Gao [11] established mathematical model judgment logistics distribution demand points transfer points used GA solve path planning model logistics distribution conducted simplified study model [11]. summarizing literature, scholars done research marine network resources, ship route optimization, power system energy, emergency supply optimization. Taking Maritime Silk Road background, studies using GA study ship network scheduling. response digital trade barriers, terms international digital trade, Liu et al. [12] conducted empirical study export potential influencing factors digital trade countries along 'Belt Road Initiative' [12]. Shang et al. [13] made detailed review exploration obstacles barriers development digital service trade. research literature found many related studies qualitative analysis interpretation evaluation 'Belt Road' policy analysis factors affecting trade. research transportation network scheduling trade potential analysis Maritime Silk Road relatively scarce, even fewer studies implementation models carry data statistics potential estimation trading partners. easy fall optimal solution prematurely single GA, resulting unsatisfactory optimization scheduling effect. single simulated annealing algorithm (SAA) optimization efficiency relatively poor cannot fully meet requirements network scheduling optimization.

Secondly, traditional GA improved using SAA, optimization process ship network scheduling improved GA constructed. reason improving GA minimum value message transmission jitter matrix period shipping network obtained, search efficiency GA improved, optimal results ship network scheduling obtained. Finally, test message delivery rate ship TTCAN protocol analyzed. Meanwhile, constructing time-varying stochastic frontier gravity model, detailed comparison international digital trade potential China countries along western route Maritime Silk Road carried out. innovation research lies constructing optimization process ship network scheduling Maritime Silk Road based improved GA SAA, time-varying stochastic frontier gravity model used analyze trade potential. aimed providing reference research international digital trade maritime transportation networks China countries along Maritime Silk Road.2. Research Theoretical Basis Model Method2.1. Maritime Silk Road Theory Digital Trade BarriersThe 'Maritime Silk Road 21st Century' includes two parts: first part westward, China's coastal ports South China Sea, Indian Ocean, finally extending Europe. second part southward, China's coastal ports South China Sea South Pacific. terms international trade, western route already foundation cooperation, many large-scale projects implemented. countries western route responded positively policy, political mutual trust two sides relatively high [7]. analyze scale digital trade exports, 21 countries along Silk Road selected divided four regions according traditional geography, shown Figure 1.In Figure 1, Southeast Asia includes Singapore Malaysia. Central Asia includes Kyrgyzstan. West Asia North Africa cover Turkey, Israel, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Greece. Eastern Europe involves Russia, Bulgaria, Belarus, Hungary, Croatia, Poland, Serbia, Lithuania, Estonia, Slovenia, Latvia, Czech Republic, Slovakia [15].2.2. International Digital TradeDigital trade driven globalization, new technologies, new demands, new rules global trade governance. help Internet platforms, intellectual property-intensive products services used trade objects. continuous development technologies big data cloud computing, forms digital trade gradually enriched. Figure 2 indicates connotation digital trade three dimensions: mode, content, subject trade [16].In Figure 2, perspective trade mode, digital trade divided digital ordering, digital delivery, platform support. viewpoint trade mode, digital trade covers split goods, information, services. point trade subject, digital trade involves three levels: enterprise, individual, government.Although digital trade great potential development, digital trade covers information data various industries communications, public services, finance, involves personal privacy national security, still many digital trade barriers various countries certain extent. Trade barriers restrictions importation goods services. Digital trade barriers mainly manage control information data [17]. Digital trade barriers manifest different forms, expressed Figure 3.As portrayed Figure 3, first localization requirements enterprises. Enterprises need store manage data countries. second market access control; mainly, government regulates inflow foreign companies domestic market. third personal information protection policy. government uses series means improve level information security effectively supervise manage data. fourth issue intellectual property rights, mainly issues patents related intellectual property rights involved digital trade. fifth uncertainty legal liability, makes easy cause disputes tortious acts. sixth censorship measures. government use effective censorship measures restrict online information inquiries. seventh customs measures, means relevant measures customs unclear complex [8].2.3. Process GAGA incorporates theory 'survival fittest' characteristics self-adaptation, randomness, high parallelism [18]. GA uses evolution process 'chromosome' survival fittest simulate process problem-solving. iteration population, chromosomes evaluated pros cons. many iterations, optimal solution problem finally obtained [19]. process GA exhibited Figure 4.In Figure 4, parameters input first, number iterations set 0. set chromosomes randomly generated initial population, fitness values chromosomes population calculated. Then, determined whether termination criterion met. satisfied, calculation stopped output optimal result, solution process ends; not, next step executed. According preset crossover probability, selection crossover operation performed. mutation operation carried mutation probability generate mutation population, criterion judgment continued.2.4. Ship Network Structure Using High-Speed TTCAN ProtocolThe studied ship network high-speed TTCAN protocol, communicates information. Data transfer network requires specific time window managing predicting information network. Taking time judgment basis, master node TTCAN, uses counter realize complete storage node time copy, counter accumulates 1 point every 1 unit [20]. composition structure TTCAN includes time slot time window, single message complete transmission nodes network time window. matrix period TTCAN, determines future development scheduling network, optimal scheduling results applicable\",\n",

IntroductionThe Silk Road long history, since inception Han Dynasty, trade route spans three continents: Asia, Africa, Europe [1]. However, passage time influence human activities, ecological environment along Silk Road changed greatly years, especially due serious land degradation increase desert area, become serious prominent environmental problems along route. Therefore, redevelop economy along Silk Road, environment energy prominent issues stage [2–4]. Therefore, full-scale construction Silk Road belt, necessary break obstacle environmental energy problems development plan development strategy meet possible challenges [5].Nowadays, economic globalization trade liberalization gradually increasing, traditional trade barriers tariffs, quotas, licenses weakened, followed rapid momentum trade protectionism based trade barriers, increasingly affects smooth flow economic trade [6–9]. developed countries take advantage differences developing countries terms environmental standards technology levels set harsh, complicated, unfair product standards import export regulations restrict introduction products countries, forming tight comprehensive trade protection network [10]. name protecting global ecological environment, trade barriers intentionally used developed countries disguise trade barriers complex reasonable legal forms national trade protection. developed countries take advantage deficiencies developing countries science technology set product standards developing countries' products cannot reach trade barriers products developing countries suffer certain losses obstacles export trade [11]. So, seems continuous establishment trade barriers great negative impact export products, become one serious problems trade barriers encountered China since accession WTO.

       " \"Digital Silk Road: China's Quest Wire World Win Future,Jonathan E Hillman, Profile Books, £20.00 China take internet? world's largest online population, estimated one billion users, booming digital industry, China expanded global digital footprint recent years. Chinese tech multinationals built backbone telecommunication infrastructure used millions people across world. China stands become even significant actor shaping internet foreseeable future Digital Silk Road, digital component Beijing's multibillion-dollar Belt Road Initiative. Introduced 2015, Digital Silk Road brings advanced infrastructure, fibre-optic cables, data centres, 5G networks, Cloud solutions smart cities countries worldwide. Rather well-defined set projects, China's digital initiative seems umbrella term collection telecommunications data-related products services delivered China-based companies. Digital Silk Road, Jonathan Hillman delves key features China's digital expansion terms ‘the network wars' opposing United States China. Assiduously researched compellingly written, book starts examining rise China technological superpower, provides description ‘the battlefield', ends offering suggestions America emerge triumphantly. seven chapters, Hillman covers many aspects Digital Silk Road, ranging Huawei-installed networks Glasgow, Montana, submarine cable connecting Pakistan East Africa Europe; BeiDou Satellite systems safe city surveillance equipment Hangzhou, well facial-recognition software used repress predominantly Muslim Uyghurs Xinjiang. Entitled ‘CTR +C', second chapter worth mentioning depiction Huawei's rise unique case copying stealing. Beyond benefiting generous government subsidies, documents Huawei stole secrets competitors' laboratories, showrooms computers. also poached top engineers hired coaching services IBM US firms improve internal management. Here, Hillman succumbs common pitfall picturing technological imitation Chinese characteristic, culturally driven practice defines Chinese firms. means specific China. history late development, catching up, one emulation, reversed engineering, indeed outright stealing. US applied strict protectionist measures 19th century continued copying British inventions long independence. book sheds light stories marginalized communities US, left American market-based approach telecommunications coverage. communities, like developing countries, left better alternative Chinese companies Huawei, provide financially competitive services. Hillman argues developing countries disadvantaged groups, data security secondary issue, priority. Ultimately, choice providers comes price. heart Digital Silk Road lies unsubstantiated claim global digital data could secure collected, stored controlled western companies allies. Yet, remains unclear expensive, US-based tech firms would represent safer options developing countries. shown Edward Snowden, US National Security Agency accessed data millions people, America abroad, tapping directly servers Facebook, Google, Microsoft Yahoo, among others. far, evidence similar global surveillance programme conducted Beijing. say Chinese engage spying – certainly – everyone else. Computer networks began allow espionage unimaginable scale 1960s heightened period Cold War. Now, spying done comfort desk chair. argued Washington's relentless campaign ban Huawei less potential security threat Chinese tech firms present fear US losing long-held dominance cyberspace. said, China building dystopian model internet mixing censorship, mass surveillance repression. Behind Great Firewall, Hillman provides thorough account increasingly controlled internet content removals, restrictions use virtual private networks, account closures systematic user-tracing arrests. Far early hypothesis internet would usher wave democratic transformations, including China, Chinese Communist Party managed use digital technologies contain dissent consolidate grip power. According Hillman, China currently charm offensive export authoritarian internet governance model developing countries. framing China active promoter internet model seems convincing, interpretation rests largely assumptions. instance, Iginio Gagliardone's China, Africa Future Internet shows China's presence Africa's digital space taken different forms, China supporting locally rooted visions information society, adapting adjusting democratic autocratic settings. related concern Digital Silk Road idea ‘China' homogenous entity clearly defined project, master plan conquer global internet. Hillman's characterization China vague assumes intrinsic characteristics apply Chinese actors. distinction drawn private state-owned firms. account, Communist Party pulls strings. However, 2020 Chinese crackdown tech titans suggests complex story. Alibaba, China's giant e-commerce group, fined $2.8 billion breaching anti-monopoly rules, Jack Ma, co-founder chief executive, China's richest man, forced lay low several months. Strict new regulations targeting Chinese tech companies, taxi-hailing apps online-tuition platforms, mirror CCP's desire rein power digital capital indicate existing tensions state's interests digital entrepreneurs. Hillman concludes policy solutions allow America win ongoing ‘network war'. Recognizing information empire emerged without active state behind it, author calls industrial policy supporting US tech firms. also suggests creation large coalition democratic countries, reminiscent Cold War grouping, curtail China's digital authoritarianism. Beyond Hillman's alarmist discourse Manichean language dividing global internet two distinct camps, lies nuanced reality. Ultimately, Digital Silk Road unlikely reproduce Beijing's blueprint internet governance presumably end taking different shapes different countries, mix infrastructures, hardware, software practices mirror pre-existing local ecosystems social preferences.\",\n",

Perhaps important Belt Road Initiative. Belt Road Initiative (BRI, also called One Belt One Road), Xi announced great fanfare 2013, initially consisted two major components: Silk Road Economic Belt 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. initiatives added recent years, including Digital Silk Road, Arctic Silk Road, Health Silk Road, Space Silk Road. 'silk road' useful metaphor ChiComs, carries historical, cultural, psychological ramifications exploited propagandized (for example, Westerners know Marco Polo was). ancient Silk Road existed 1,400 years, connecting China East Asia Europe Middle East. purpose promotion two-way trade commerce providing overland transportation network facilitate distribution storage trade goods along routes. ancient Silk Road fell disuse severed Turks captured Constantinople (now Istanbul). BRI modern version ancient Silk Road intended interlink Central Asia common economic market dominated Beijing; expand authoritarian Chinese mercantilist system Europe, Middle East, Africa order replace existing Western international rules-based order. general view Trieste Old Port Trieste, Italy, April 2, 2019. historic city Trieste preparing open new port China, Italy becoming first G-7 nation sign China's Belt Road infrastructure project. (Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images) overarching BRI objective develop global infrastructure controlled China, various 'roads' serving spokes wheel service hub (mainland China). Another analogy would spider's web expanding ever outward, Beijing (the 'Spider Dragon') center web. infrastructure elements largely focused development transportation assets later exploited Beijing transport resources raw materials needed fuel Chinese manufacturing concerns, well support exportation finished Chinese goods overseas markets around world, including roads, ports, railroads, bridges, etc. BRI investments also include renewable energy projects, communications infrastructures, cultural exchanges. Silk Roads promote controlling worldwide technology standards, dominating Arctic trade routes, influencing worldwide health initiatives ways profitable communist China, exploitation space technologies People's Liberation Army. described here, ChiComs believe BRI ticket worldwide economic hegemony future 'controlling access key resources, exporting idle industrial capacity, even tilting world order favor.' last observation key BRI, Xi envisions China becoming world's preeminent economic superpower not-too-distant future, personal prestige tightly intertwined success nearly $1 trillion planned investment 138 countries around world (and counting). Green Belt Road Initiative Center reported January 'Chinese investments 138 countries Belt Road Initiative show overall investments BRI 2020 US$47 billion.' Thus, ChiComs' mercantilist authoritarian capitalist spiderweb extended two-thirds world's 195 countries (and counting). Chinese investments associated BRI come strings attached, grants rather loans must paid back. Countries receiving investments often pay back loans granting Chinese long-term exploitation rights natural resources and/or long-term lease arrangement ports, railroads, infrastructure developed using BRI loans. ChiComs' loan-payback mechanism frequently described 'debt-trap diplomacy,' excellent summary works provided here. debt trap problem also exacerbated developing countries ruled corrupt dictators siphon BRI loans private accounts instead intended use infrastructure development.

Digital Silk Road ties directly another major initiative, China Standards 2035, aims 'set global rules across industries, especially emerging technologies.' Control standards; control technologies. noted here, Xi continues repeat platitudes 'multilateral cooperation trade investment' 'closer partnership openness inclusiveness' whenever discusses 'high quality Belt Road cooperation.' uses latest buzzwords motivate Westerners days, too, including 'green clean,' 'people-centered,' 'sustainable' without ever defining exactly terms really mean. reality, words phrases window dressing mask ChiCom intentions aimed squarely access control natural resources intimidation BRI 'partners' bills Chinese loans come due. public pronouncements, Xi openly propagandized supposed altruism Chinese Communist Party (CCP) pursuing BRI, reality opposite—just Xi's grandiose announcements involving multilateral cooperation, mutual benefits, 'shared future' mankind. Xi neglects state 'shared future' arranged CCP's terms, existing free market-based international order. CCP's view 'sharing future' China 'share – control' countries provide natural resources needed fuel Chinese industry, BRI debt traps mechanisms effect 'sharing.' Captive Nations Coalition Committee Present Danger: China perfectly deciphers 'Xi-speak' BRI first annual report (emphasis added): 'The practical effect, therefore, debt-trap enabled build-out global Chinese colonial empire.' Conclusion Silk road, hub-and spoke, spiderweb, Spider Dragon (Beijing)—all roads lead communist China. ChiCom altruism really ChiCom control, BRI aimed squarely latter, former!

[Photo provided China Daily] Belt Road Initiative (BRI) remains one China's important global programs. past, efforts related promoting primary targets initiative, land-based Silk Road Economic Belt sea-based 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. recent years, China expanded efforts introduction Digital Silk Road, Green Silk Road, Health Silk Road Polar Silk Road. Developments four areas already changed BRI landscape. Delving specific dimensions BRI demonstrate initiative's future roadmap showcase clear picture relevant investment implications. Among four pillars introduced respectively digital, green, health polar, Green Silk Road looks make BRI projects greener sustainable. Chinese policymakers increasingly focused sustainable BRI recent years. scope Green Silk Road includes reducing carbon emissions, cutting pollution protecting biodiversity, also ensuring improved economic opportunities countries involved. believe three main reasons behind China's push develop Green Silk Road. First, fits growing global trend prioritizing sustainable development. Green Silk Road viewed effective solution promote implementation United Nations' 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development. Green Silk Road also serves key enabler China seeks achieve goals peaking carbon dioxide emissions 2030 achieving carbon neutrality 2060. Climate change one humanity's greatest challenges concerted efforts required globally, especially emerging developing economies. countries face rising energy needs grow, industrialize urbanize. Infrastructure investment decisions today lock emissions trajectories decades make break ability countries achieve sustainability objectives. underscores importance Green Silk Road driving sustainable development Belt Road region. Second, since launch BRI, Western academia civil society voiced concerns alleged environmental impacts extensive infrastructure development. Green Silk Road response criticism lays solid foundation wider global recognition BRI. Third, many countries involved BRI lagging terms sustainable development. China's emphasis Green Silk Road allows country set green standards BRI projects make sustainability defining feature BRI cooperation agreements. Looking back, witnessed Green Silk Road progress demonstrates great efforts undertaken broader sense. Chinese officials actively promoted Green Silk Road setting various guidelines partnership agreements. late 2018, China released Green Investment Principles (GIP) BRI — set principles greener investments countries regions participating BRI. June 2021, 39 large international financial institutions embraced GIP. 2019, BRI International Green Development Coalition established engage dialogue, exchanges, joint research, capacity building activities. since attracted 150 Chinese foreign partners 40 countries, garnered positive response widespread support international community. mid-2021, China also published Green Development Guidelines Overseas Investment Cooperation Guidelines Ecological Environmental Protection Foreign Investment Cooperation Construction Projects. two programs focus environmental risk management overseas BRI projects supply chains. key aspect BRI, Chinese officials also shown significant commitment toward making energy investments BRI regions sustainable. mainly executed two ways — reducing coal-related investments increasing green energy investments. Since Chinese officials declared intention minimizing financing coal power plants abroad, coal-related investments construction projects dropped around zero 2021 2022.China also highly committed investments renewable energy solar, wind hydropower BRI-involved regions, increased 50 percent year-on-year 2022. China dominates global manufacturing industry renewables, accounting 72 percent global solar manufacturing 50 percent global wind turbine manufacturing. thus well-positioned help deliver low-carbon technologies BRI countries regions. Chinese officials also cooperated local governments corporations countries regions involved BRI build green infrastructure. One notable example Lower Stung Russei Chrum hydropower station Koh Kong province, Cambodia, built owned large Chinese electric company. station entered commercial operation 2013 total installed capacity 338 megawatts annual output 1.2 billion kilowatt-hours. operation since mid-2022, project generated 8.4 billion kWh clean power helped advance Cambodia's transition toward greater use renewable energy. Another example involves technological innovation renewable energy sector floating solar farm Huainan, Anhui province. site's 160,000 solar panels installed 2017 large domestic renewable energy storage company covering huge surface area water formerly site coal mine. solar panels generate 150 megawatts electricity year, equivalent 53,000 metric tons coal, demonstrating potential solar projects along Green Silk Road. Given efforts mentioned thus far, expect China's BRI projects become greener sustainable long term. believe developments across countries regions involved BRI likely become sustainable time, turn support better long-term investment opportunities there. Bond issuers looking invest sustainable development regions may benefit mega trend long run. Anthony Xiao client portfolio manager fixed income team Invesco, global investment management company.

ICOs, smart contracts allow fundraising venture execute sufficient investors agreed financing terms. exchange funding venture, investors receive token, kind digital share certificate recorded blockchain. Although ICOs provide innovative potentially important vehicle support fundraising new ventures ideas, lack regulation rampant fraud raised serious regulatory concerns became popular years ago. this, see Zetzsche et al., \"The ICO gold rush: scam, bubble, super challenge regulators\", Harvard International Law Journal, vol. 60, no. 2, 2019. ICOs banned PRC Mainland since September 2017 (PBOC, CAC, MIIT, SAIC, CBRC, CSRC, CIRC Announcement Preventing Financial Risks Initial Coin Offerings). ICOs remain restricted PRC, legally regulated Hong Kong Taiwan Security Token Offerings (\"STO\"). STOs combine power ICO stringent regulations securities market. Integrating digital Yuan eventual STO regime would revolutionary couple different ways. First, allowing STOs — whether Hong Kong PRC assuming legalized — denominated DCEP would greatly benefit fundraising innovative space. would win private investors government: investors gain access powerful new fundraising tool, government monitor regulate STOs financial exchanges bringing within fold Chinese securities laws. would allow regulators implement mandatory disclosure rules protect investors risks fraud associated ICOs, displace unofficial cryptocurrencies channeling existing ICO action legitimate STO system. Together, changes would make institutional investors likely treat STOs serious investment opportunities. result, enabling DCEP support STOs would cement DCEP\\'s appeal fundraisers institutional investors helping government keep tabs new activity public exchanges. Legalizing STOs allowing denominated DCEP also opens major new underwriting opportunities property insurers. Say, example, opportunity presents new insurance line business — new Chinese rocket company wants launch missions space replenish International Space Station, launch new satellite. Given risks, cannot find insurer willing underwrite sell insurance policy. DCEP-denominated STO, insurer could decide underwrite policy condition STO attracts adequate number co-insurers reinsurers, exchange tokens financial assets. there\\'s adequate market interest STO listed, policy would launch (as would rocket ship!), divided token shares, distributed insurer reinsurer\\'s book business exchange DCEP payments. STO written, subsequent steps would happen automatically significantly reduce transaction costs.

First bit recap. Semiconductors really fundamental underlying technology here, Chip Wars explains. They're crucial precision weaponry, also underlie key contested technologies — wireless networking technology relies chips switch data streams, AI relies chips like GPUs ASICs. Take away chips, can't really anything. U.S. export controls focused semiconductor industry, China trying hard catch up. Wireless dominance defined much technological capabilities; since there's strong network effect, whichever provider underbid everyone else typically gets sole provider everything. past decade, Chinese juggernaut Huawei, used Chinese government assistance underbid (and cases, destroy) Western rivals. Wireless Wars explains, one way prevent might move open system different providers provide different pieces wireless tech, allowing America compete effectively China. open-RAN technology, called, still technically challenging. AI, meanwhile, wild card; we've vividly seen GPT-4 past days, nobody really knows fast-progressing field headed. end dominating it, whether even dominated, would mean, still air. said, however, AI Superpowers remarkably bad job dealing topic — stubbornly avoiding talk military applications, making bunch bad predictions AI already falsified events. Anyway, brief reviews next three books. going follow footsteps read books, Wires War book probably read first. gives rapid informative overview subjects covered others. importantly, explains developed democracies engaging technological competition China first place. 'why fight' book. easy assume U.S. democratic allies ought try maintain technological supremacy China. many, U.S. hegemony end unto itself; others, fact Chinese Communist Party nasty regime nasty things people reason enough want world's dominant power. many people U.S., reasons worth higher consumer prices loss Chinese market result technological competition, mention taxes needed fund industrial policies. Wires War explains threat U.S. power China's oppressed minorities. China key ally Russia bear active enmity toward developed democracies, even hitting U.S. allies cyberattacks information operations that, although fall short actual war, clearly hostile acts. Maintaining lead chips, AI, networking technology important self-defense — especially low-level attacks escalate point. Now, true Russia far aggressive toward U.S. Europe China has. Wires War weakness, starts mostly describing attacks Russia, pivots arguing need reorient policy toward competition China. argument prioritize competition capable rival instead aggressive rival — strongly agree — requires nuanced holistic understanding geopolitics book always provide. overall make case pretty strongly; expected find book overly hawkish, found nodding along pretty much everything. Wires War also deals disconnect tech industry West Coast U.S. political defense establishment East Coast. China, companies work hand-in-glove military, U.S. often ignore work cross purposes.

AI superpowers placed strong emphasis data, Four Battlegrounds de-emphasizes factor. Scharre points China's supposed supremacy data probably important, since machine learning models finicky need trained data sets specific tasks. China train models recognize face every Chinese citizen, necessarily help models recognize targets battlefield. talent, AI Superpowers focused hard-charging Chinese entrepreneurs, Four Battlegrounds shifts focus AI engineers.

Anyway, want read book AI competition U.S. China, Four Battlegrounds good one. book unfortunate title, since least three books exact name. make sure get right one! Digital Silk Road networking technology — wireless infrastructure, broadband, internet cables, communications satellites, networked devices (the 'internet things'). basically much broader, comprehensive look topic Jonathan Pelson's Wireless Wars , though means necessarily deals technology far abbreviated fashion.

Another day, another communist Chinese grand initiative.

Let us examine topic. Xi loves announcing initiatives keynote speeches given various friendly audiences. example, introduced BRI (also known 'One Belt, One Road') speech Nazarbayev University, Astana, Kazakhstan, September 2013. announced Digital Silk Road keynote speech China-ASEAN Expo Nanning September 2020.

Xi repeated expanded upon gobbledygook past years, views 'security' propagated endlessly state-run Chinese media. example, CCP mouthpiece People's Daily reminded us April 2 Xi 'has consistently advocated vision common, comprehensive, cooperative sustainable security, inspiring human society march towards lasting peace universal security.' associated policies Xi supposedly advocates include international arms control, disarmament non-proliferation, nuclear strategy self-defense, active role global peacekeeping operations.

World Bank pointed $18 trillion \"infrastructure gap\" what\\'s needed what\\'s provided already. \"If implemented sustainably responsibly, (the Belt Road Initiative) potential meet longstanding developing country needs spur global economic growth,\" Council Foreign Relations report concluded. However, report cited several risks that, collectively, \"considerably outweigh benefits.\" frequently raised concerns: • Projects Belt Road Initiative transparent organized traditional organizations like World Bank. initiative \"flouts best practices areas like transparent governance, environmental standards labor rights,\" Daly said. Notably, China \"doesn\\'t generally conduct rigorous economic environmental social-impact studies first,\" Sacks said. \"If customer wants it, build it. lend autocrats. autocrat wants soccer stadium, they\\'ll build it, even vanity project.\" • China build infrastructure based technologies standards, gives competitive edge future rounds development, especially digital networks. \"If country using 5G technology Huawei (a Chinese company), comes technical specifications make much likely country ready 6G, either choice use Huawei technology, least cheaper option,\" Sacks said. Western nations said telecommunications systems based Chinese technology could vulnerable spying, especially broad surveillance networks built initiative. Surveillance systems \"won\\'t turn democracy autocracy, help non-democratic leaders cement control,\" Sacks said. • energy projects far predominantly carbon-based rather renewable. tendency \"the potential lock countries decades non-renewable energy sources,\" Sacks said, marking disconnect China\\'s claims global stage supports move toward reducing carbon emissions. • Countries left heavily indebted China. One oft-cited example Hambantota Port Sri Lanka, host country unable repay loans, China instead got 99-year lease port. However, even critics Belt Road Initiative acknowledge Sri Lanka example clear-cut indictment China. deal struck initiative launched, story \"implicates local Sri Lankan officials chose work China advance political interests,\" Markey said. fact, research Deborah Brautigam, director China-Africa Research Initiative Johns Hopkins University, suggests evidence Chinese banks systematically over-lending swoop seize assets borrowers default. Still, multiple aspects initiative run counter Western interests, Markey said. \"While every aspect worrisome even likely conflict U.S. allied interests, whole poses strategic challenge requires sort thoughtful policy response,\" said. June summit, G-7 nations put forth plan offer alternative Belt Road Initiative. White House statement described \"values-driven, high-standard transparent infrastructure partnership led major democracies\" would stretch \"Latin America Caribbean Africa Indo-Pacific.\" United States cited \"lead partner,\" leveraging existing entities Development Finance Corp., U.S. Agency International Development, Export-Import Bank, Millennium Challenge Corp., U.S. Trade Development Agency support mission. Experts described \"Build Back Better World\" program good first step, also warned limitations. instance, G-7 leaders initially specify top-line figure investments, observers called \"patchwork\" effort seek leverage significant cooperation institutions experience global development, notably World Bank. critical question, Hillman said, \"whether effectively mobilize private capital, real untapped financial firepower resides.\" Another concern may credible, reasonably priced alternative China certain types projects, including 5G networks high-speed rail, due limited suppliers West, Sacks said. Overall, Markey said he\\'s \"underwhelmed\" proposal far — added he\\'s also worried verdict point. \"I would prefer U.S. friends try compete China terms,\" Markey said. \"It would much better U.S. tries compete China areas enjoys greater advantages.

       " \"Authored Mihai Macovei via Mises Institute, Biden administration US continued escalating economic geopolitical frictions China. recent G7 Summit Carbis Bay, President Biden sought rally 'united front' China traditional G7 allies new ones Australia, India, South Korea, South Africa rebuked China economic policies, human rights, tensions East South China Seas. US also persuaded G7 allies back massive infrastructure support package developing countries. so-called Build Back Better World Partnership (B3W) de facto rival China's Belt Road Initiative (BRI). far obvious West stands gain emulating China's exorbitant highly controversial modern 'Silk Road' venture. US's Ambitious Global Infrastructure Plan B3W wants mobilize 'hundreds billions dollars infrastructure investment,' order narrow estimated infrastructure need $40 trillion plus developing world. B3W financing expected come US budgetary instruments, Development Finance Corporation United States Agency International Development (USAID); multilateral development banks (MDBs), World Bank; private sector G7 partners. B3W meant challenge China's project, expect least match Chinese financial envelope, commonly estimated $1 trillion investment lending commitments far. eight times higher nearly $113 billion official development assistance $22 billion private sector investment provided G7 countries foreign infrastructure projects 2015–19 (graph 1). Graph 1: G7 Infrastructure Development Assistance Source: Center Strategic International Studies (CSIS). order surpass China, B3W aims broader geographical coverage, wider focus, better project governance standards. BRI comprises 'Silk Road Economic Belt' trying link China Asia, Russia, Europe land, 'Maritime Silk Road,' connecting China's coastal regions Asia, South Pacific, Africa, Europe, Western challenger aims global scope. Chinese initiative focused traditional infrastructure projects—highways, railroads, ports, power plants, B3W wants invest also climate, health digital technology. Chinese projects heavily criticized lack transparency, corruption, unsustainable debt adverse environmental social impacts, B3W advertises 'a values-driven, high-standard, transparent infrastructure partnership led major democracies.' Holes China's 'Silk Road' announcement 2013, China's megainfrastructure project met suspicion West. important, feared China geostrategic ambitions bring smaller BRI partners sphere influence. also claimed China pursuing 'debt-trap diplomacy' order take key strategic assets electric grids ports, latter could also used military purposes. time, many analysts realized much criticism exaggerated. First, almost 140 countries signed BRI writing, eighteen EU, showing many governments find Chinese deal beneficial. although China financed full promised $1 trillion projects far, make $190 billion worth investments $390 billion construction work (financed Chinese loans general) 2014–18. $467 billion development loans provided World Bank 2008–19. Second, number requests debt renegotiation relief increased, overseas asset seizures rarely occurred. Third, many pundits concur BRI ports commercially designed almost impossible employ militarily. Undeniably, China trying enhance political influence BRI, perceived influential economic actor Southeast Asia Africa. resentments onerous projects, corruption scandals, increasing debt burdens mean gains could easily reversed, China started improve lending investment standards. BRI focus widened traditional infrastructure telecommunications, digital technology, fintech. China also expanded BRI's overarching goal helping build free trade investment area would accelerate economic growth partner countries. BRI's economic benefits skewed favor Chinese construction companies expense taxpayers. BRI provided much business China's overstretched construction sector end domestic stimulus binge following Great Recession. Almost 90 percent construction works funded BRI went Chinese contractors, fueling criticism BRI creates unfair advantages Chinese companies, become global leaders. Seven ten largest construction companies world revenue Chinese 2017. time, China wanted set debt trap BRI, seems country fallen it. pandemic accelerated already growing debt defaults renegotiations estimated $94 billion, quarter China's overseas lending, come renegotiation far (graph 2). shows BRI's important lenders, i.e. China's two main policy banks—the China Development Bank Export-Import Bank China—have done poor job financing viable projects, Chinese taxpayer likely foot bill eventually.3 given sizeable amount investments put hold, scaled back, cancelled, low participation private lenders, obvious BRI participating governments made several bad investment decisions too. Graph 2: China's Debt Renegotiation Cases Source: Rhodium Group Research. 2013–17, BRI looked pretty successful growing fast terms contracts signed loans. high-profile contracts cancelled debt renegotiations surged, project ran steam. China's big banks started rethinking reducing overseas lending number construction contracts went (graph 3). also driven deleveraging Chinese banks large credit expansion following global financial crisis. China's large domestic growth stimuli weakened external competitiveness reduced current account surpluses outward FDI (foreign direct investment). balance payments crisis 2015–16, accompanied drop international reserves $1 trillion imposition capital controls, reduced China's ability fund massive overseas demand infrastructure projects investment. addition, domestic voices started question Chinese people, also relatively poor, subsidize unprofitable capital investment overseas. Graph 3: China's Overseas Construction Contracts Source: Rhodium Group. West Go China's Road? pouring money B3W, US heed important lessons China's BRI venture past. First, trying fill $40 trillion plus infrastructure gap developing world requires massive amount resources. printing trillions US dollars enough, real savings, i.e., goods services, need transferred abroad current account surpluses. order carry mammoth BRI projects, China recorded large current account surpluses drew huge international reserves. Japanese companies also long history building infrastructure across Southeast Asia also backed substantial current account surpluses several decades. hand, US UK running chronic current account deficits, euro area started register small surpluses years ago (graph 4). Graph 4: Current Account Balances Source: OECD Statistics. addition, US EU launch large domestic growth stimuli, including substantial green digital investments, likely strain feeble domestic real savings. Moreover, President Biden's economic agenda includes important measures, tax minimum wage hikes higher social spending, likely increase consumption depressing economic activity savings. Lastly, investment share GDP already relatively low US EU, calling question economic rationale government-led transfer capital overseas (graph 5). Graph 5: Domestic Investment Ratios Source: World Bank Data. second lesson BRI slowed domestic resources dwindled, also wasteful projects bad debts became visible. US allies seem convinced that, unlike BRI, projects profitable transparent. history tells us. Jeffrey Tucker shows true intent much-hailed Marshall Plan help foreign countries, internationalize New Deal American taxpayer subsidize US corporates. plan drained private capital US economy, country fell recession shortly thereafter. also helped entrench unionism, welfare states, heavy regulations Europe. According Ryan McMaken, history building transcontinental railroads US also rife crony capitalism corruption. track record conditional development lending International Monetary Fund, World Bank, institutions supposed back B3W spotless either. institutions rarely able support viable projects economic liberalization: given role global lenders last resort, must prop foreign governments usually overbureaucratic corrupt. conclusion, US wants strengthen economic geostrategic position versus China, needs apply free market principles made prosperous powerful first place. Launching second Marshall Plan, mirrors China's wasteful BRI, consolidate big government, crony capitalism, corruption, eroding US economy's capital stock competitiveness.\",\n",
