The report details Beijing's decades-long infiltration campaign in the West.\nThrough heavy state subsidies and international lobbying efforts, Beijing has embedded Huawei's technology in a wide array of infrastructure around the world. Western governments are becoming increasingly aware of the security threats, including data gathering and industrial espionage. Huawei has repeatedly denied such allegations.\nIllicit Data Collecting and Espionage\nMany Chinese state-owned telecommunications companies are heavily subsidized—especially Huawei—to win overseas contracts, the report said. Consequently, Huawei has brought legitimate security concerns to countries using its technology, or where its employees carry out clandestine operations.\nIn 2019, the United States found that Huawei had access to 4G equipment through backdoors installed in its system since 2009. The details were disclosed to the United Kingdom and Germany the same year.\n'We have evidence that Huawei has the capability to secretly access sensitive and personal information in systems it maintains and sells around the world,' then U.S. national security adviser Robert O'Brien told Wall Street Journal in February 2020.\nSimilarly, Dutch landline and mobile telecommunications company KPN, which had been using Huawei technology since 2009, was previously warned of spy activities by Dutch domestic intelligence service AIVD.\nA 2010 report made available to KPN confirmed Huawei's surveillance activities such as eavesdropping on the Dutch mobile network customers, including the prime minister and government officials, obtaining personal contacts from mobile devices; and it could potentially disable the entire network. However, this report was kept confidential until the Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant wrote an exposé on Huawei's underhanded operations\xa0in April this year.\nAlso in 2019, two cases of Huawei employees accused of spying for the CCP were exposed in Poland and in the Czech Republic.\nA Huawei sales director in Poland was arrested by Polish authorities based on allegations that his work with Huawei was a front to spy for the CCP. Huawei terminated this employee immediately after his arrest, stating 'the allegations have nothing to do with the company.'\nTwo former Huawei employees in the Czech Republic told Czech public radio that they collected and shared sensitive client information with Chinese authorities. The data was entered into an internal database managed by Huawei's headquarters in China. The targeted clients include state officials, mainly department directors or deputy ministers, who would then be invited to a conference or a trip to China.\nHuawei has repeatedly denied working with the Chinese regime.\n Chinese leader Xi Jinping virtually addresses the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly in New York on Sept. 21, 2021.

The report said that 'such leadership positions, although [they] can't fully control the agencies, but can provide [the] CCP the opportunities to advance its influence, such as in the process of defining international standards.'\nLi Yong, former deputy treasury minister of China, has led the U.N. Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) since 2013. Li set up a new bureau under UNIDO to control which country is eligible for what kind of partnership program, and appointed another CCP official to run it.\xa0Li also promoted Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI, also known as 'One Belt, One Road'), in which Huawei is a key player. In November 2019, Li signed a contract with the vice president of Huawei to strengthen the cooperation between UNIDO and Huawei.\nZhao Houlin, who worked at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in China, served as deputy secretary and later secretary of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) since 2007. On numerous occasions, Zhao emphasized the importance of cooperating with China's Digital Silk Road, a\xa0long-term plan to lead the world into global connectivity under a Sino-centric global digital order, and Huawei's technology supports the initiative.\nAt the first Belt and Road Forum in May 2017, Zhao said Huawei's 5G technologies do not cause security issues. In 2020, Huawei and other Chinese state-run companies and government agencies proposed to the ITU a drastically different new standard for internet technology, which called for more state intervention.\nMilitary and Intelligence Agency Ties\nThe French report said that Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei, had close ties to the Chinese military. In the 1990s, Huawei built a communications network for military use, which established the special partnership between the company and the People's Liberation Army.\nIn 2013, India's Intelligence Bureau reported that Huawei and ZTE are part of the Chinese military's High Tech Research and Development (863) Program. Under this program, Huawei focused on switches and routers. At the time, Huawei had been operating in India for over 12 years with R&D centers that had over 6,000 employees.\nThe report cited an investigation by Forbes about Huawei and Guangzhou Boyu Information Technology Co. (known as Boyusec), which is identified as one of China's hacker groups. In 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice\xa0charged three Chinese hackers associated with Boyusec and identified them as the co-founder, executive director, and an employee of the company.\xa0Boyusec is a Chinese government contractor. It is linked to the APT3 hacker group that actively targeted Hong Kong and the United States.\nA November 2016\xa0report\xa0by Washington Free Beacon stated: 'According to an internal report by the Pentagon's Joint Staff J-2 intelligence directorate, Boyusec and Huawei are working together to produce security products that will be loaded into Chinese-manufactured computer and telephone equipment. The doctored products will allow Chinese intelligence to capture data and control computer and telecommunications equipment.'\nHuawei dismissed the allegation and claimed that it only asked Boyusec to provide security analysis.\nXinjiang Rights Abuses\nGerman researcher Adrian Zenz is the leading expert on the Uyghur crisis in China. The French report quoted Zenz as saying that Huawei is involved in the surveillance and detention of Uyghurs in Xinjiang.\n The outer wall of a so-called 're-education camp' is equipped with several surveillance cameras in China's northwestern Xinjiang region on May 31, 2019. (Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images)\nHuawei denied the accusation.\nIn a June 2020\xa0report,\xa0Zenz said\xa0'the company [Huawei] does engage in business with the security services in Xinjiang, worked with them for years on dedicated, custom-made security solutions, and it even proudly advertises how they are being operated.'\nZenz found that one former Huawei engineer worked on the 'Kashgar Public Security Surveillance and Video Link Network Project.' Kashgar is home to a majority Uyghur population in Xinjiang.\nZenz continued in his report: 'Further evidence of Huawei's collaboration with Xinjiang's security authorities, including a strategic research collaboration with the public security agencies in Urumqi have been described by others, such as the Global and Main and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. One might want to highlight the fact that\xa0Fan Lixin, deputy director of Xinjiang's Ministry of Public Security, praised the collaboration with Huawei as fulfilling key goals of the region's domestic security strategy during the 13th 5-year plan (2015-2020).'\nHuawei Communications Infrastructure in Africa\nThe French report said that Chinese companies have built and renovated at least 186 government buildings throughout Africa. These buildings include at least 24 residences or offices for the countries' leaders, at least 26 congress buildings, at least 32 military or police facilities, and at least 19 foreign ministry buildings.\nHuawei and ZTE also built at least 14 electronic communications networks for government use, including those for the police and the military.\nThe Chinese regime also donated office equipment, including computers, to 35 African countries.\nThe report said that the Chinese-made infrastructure\xa0could gather data, including personal information of politicians and persons of interest. Such data is useful in advancing Beijing's influence in Africa.\nAmong the 54 countries in Africa, 40 countries have been compromised, the report claimed.\nUndersea Cables\nUndersea cables are a crucial part of the Digital Silk Road. Huawei Marine Networks Co., Ltd. and other related companies have been investing heavily in undersea cables.\nThe report noted that in Asia, the CCP owns 30 percent of existing undersea cables and more than 50 percent of those under construction. Around the world, the CCP owns 11.4 percent of undersea cables already installed and 24 percent of those under construction. Furthermore, Huawei is contracted to build the undersea cable in the South Atlantic Ocean between Brazil and the Republic of Cameroon, connecting South America and Africa. China Unicom is also involved, the report said.\nThe CCP has the capability to cut the undersea cable in Asia, which can be used to attack Taiwan, the report said. The CCP is also developing an undersea surveillance system in South China Sea, in particular to monitor U.S. submarines.\n A model of a wave energy test site shows undersea cables that hold machinery in place at Kaneohe Bay on Oahu in Hawaii, on July 26, 2016. (Cathy Bussewitz/AP Photo)\nHuawei is Not a Private Enterprise\nHuawei is a state-owned enterprise under the control of the CCP, according to the French report, citing Christopher Balding, associate professor at the Fulbright University Vietnam and a prominent researcher on Chinese economy and financial markets.\nHuawei claims that it is a private firm owned by its founder and all its employees.\nHowever, Balding pointed out that Huawei Technologies is 99 percent owned by Huawei Investment Holdings, which is completely owned by the Huawei Investment Holdings Trade Union Committee. According to Chinese law, trade union committees are 'public organizations' that do not have shareholders. An example of a public organization would be the Communist Youth League, an organization owned by the CCP.\nChinese state-owned and private enterprises are used as the CCP's data collectors and they are legally obligated to do so, the report said.\nThe report provided a timeline, starting from 2016, on how the CCP built up this legal framework. In 2016, Xi Jinping wanted the state-owned enterprises to 'melt the Party's leadership into all aspects of enterprise management.'\nIn 2017, the CCP passed the National Intelligence Law. According to Article 7 of the law, all Chinese business entities and citizens must 'support, assist and cooperate with the state's intelligence gathering activities, and safeguard state secrets.' This also applies to Chinese companies and individuals overseas.\nIn 2020, the report 'Strengthening Private Enterprise United Front Work' was released to further exert the Party's influence over the private enterprises.

In his address via video link, Xi reiterated his vision for a digital silk road (DSR), first articulated in a 2015 government white paper as part of China\'s global infrastructure plan, the Belt and Road Initiative. The DSR covers e-commerce, smart cities, undersea fibre optic cables, 5G, data centres, smartphones, internet of things, artificial intelligence, and fintech.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

In Dakar, where the forum was held, China is funding and building a data centre to host Senegal\'s government data and digital platforms, which will move from servers in the US and Europe. Tech giant Huawei Technologies is building and supplying the centre\'s equipment, at a cost of 46 billion CFA francs (US$79 million) through a Chinese government loan. Senegalese President Macky Sall has said the move will boost his country\'s digital sovereignty. \n \n\n © Provided by South China Morning Post The \'digital silk road\' featured prominently in Chinese President Xi Jinping\'s keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation on November 29. Photo: Xinhua\n\n Abhishek Mishra, associate fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi, said the Senegal project was important because it was the first time any African country had replicated China\'s data governance model. ""The risk is that while Senegal will now control all the information, mimicking a surveillance state, the country\'s entire digital infrastructure would be subsequently dependent on Chinese technology,"" he said. ""Huawei\'s handling of such sensitive information positions China in a place of data superiority."" Biden signs legislation to tighten US restrictions on Huawei and ZTE Mishra said the data centre was not the only example of Africa\'s move towards a Chinese digital model. In June, Nigeria banned Twitter, drawing parallels with China for the censorship model it is developing. The Senegal data centre is just one of many being built by Chinese companies in Africa to keep pace with the economic and social transformation which is exerting considerable pressure on the continent\'s existing infrastructure, according to Mishra. The Africa Data Centres Association estimates 1,000MW capacity and 700 new centres will be needed. Huawei has either completed or is building multimillion-dollar data centres and cloud services in a number of African countries, including Zimbabwe, Zambia, Togo, Tanzania, Mozambique, Mali and Madagascar. Chinese and US diplomats are jostling for influence in Africa The Chinese tech giant is also powering 5G in Africa. The continent\'s first 5G stand-alone commercial network is live in South Africa and Kenya, with trials ongoing in other countries. The current 4G infrastructure depends to a large extent on support provided by Huawei. In a move which could determine control of internet communication infrastructure, Chinese companies - including China Mobile, HMN Tech (formerly Huawei Technologies Co. Marine) and Hengtong Group - are backing construction of two undersea fibre optic cables. The 15,000km (9,320 miles) Pakistan and East Africa Connecting to Europe (Peace) cable has key landing points in France, Pakistan and Kenya, with plans to extend to South Africa in its second phase. It is owned by Peace Cable International Network, a subsidiary of Chinese firm Hengtong Group, with equipment supplied by HMN Tech. Can China\'s \'digital silk road\' secure dominant role in communications? A second cable - 2Africa - is expected to go live in 2023 or early 2024 and serve the continent and the Middle East. Together, the two cables will offer the fastest communications route between China, Africa, Europe and the Middle East. The 37,000km 2Africa cable is being built for an estimated US$1 billion by China Mobile International - a subsidiary of the world\'s largest mobile phone operator China Mobile - and other mobile operators including MTN GlobalConnect, Orange, and Vodafone. According to Mishra, two things underline the DSR - the Chinese Communist Party\'s view of the digital domain as its next key sector for force projection, and its goal to prevent global digital value chains from being controlled by the West. ""By supporting regional digital infrastructure and projects that integrate the internet, big data and AI, if such projects in Africa are successful in modernising Africa\'s various industrial sectors, then it creates a 1.2 billion [people] market for its digital goods and integrates the regional industrial architecture,"" he said. ""This is all the more important since e-commerce and fintech are bound to drive national economic trajectories in African countries, particularly as the pandemic has prompted a shift towards digitalisation."" There is a commercial and strategic logic to the digital belt and road in Africa, according to Eyck Freymann, author of One Belt One Road: Chinese Power Meets the World. Africa - with its young and fast-growing population, low levels of internet penetration and huge opportunities in areas like fintech, e-commerce and agricultural tech - was recognised by Chinese tech companies as a big potential market for electronics and digital services, he said. According to Freymann, despite its recent crackdown on Big Tech, China wants to internationalise its technological platforms and experiment with things like cross-border payments using digital renminbi. Chinese smartphone users lose 1.7 million apps in 3 years ""Africa is an ideal sandbox for Chinese tech firms looking to expand abroad without raising alarms in Washington,"" he said. Analyst Rebecca Arcesati, with the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin, said deepening China\'s integration with high-growth digital ecosystems across developing and emerging economies had numerous advantages from Beijing\'s viewpoint. ""It is very much in line with China\'s economic development and innovation strategy, which aims to turn the country into a hi-tech exporter and global leader in emerging technologies, as well as a rule-maker in the digital economy,"" she said. ""Africa is a key market whose technology choices are poised to shape tomorrow\'s standards and norms in important ways."" According to Arcesati, Beijing is executing its strategy by piggybacking off commercial actors. The party-state was also seeking to control more global networks and data flows, leveraging countries\' dependence on Chinese technology to gain geopolitical influence, she said. ""It is no coincidence that Xi Jinping has highlighted the importance of smart city cooperation with African partners for years. The growing integration of the internet of things with urban infrastructure multiplies opportunities for data collection."" Robert Greene, a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace\'s Cyber Policy Initiative and Asia Programme, said Beijing was seeking to play a leading role in standard-setting for cyberspace governance and emerging technologies, including digital currencies. ""For years, Beijing has been trying to project a view of \'cyber sovereignty\' that is fundamentally at odds with how the US and other democracies conceptualise what the internet should be,"" he said. Xi renews \'cyber sovereignty\' call at China\'s internet event of the year According to Greene, Beijing\'s vision of cyber sovereignty refers to a paradigm in which national governments maintain a significant degree of autonomy, controlling content and governance over cyberspace within their borders. ""Beijing provides direct and indirect support to Chinese technology companies to help facilitate the proliferation of a \'made in China\' tech stack."" Greene said Beijing had accelerated efforts in recent years to spread its vision of cyber sovereignty in emerging markets under the banner of the digital silk road. China\'s investments in Africa\'s tech is also bound up in its geopolitical rivalry with the US which, along with some of its allies, banned Huawei on security grounds. Huawei rejects Washington\'s accusations, including claims it was allowing the Chinese government access to its equipment to spy on voice and data traffic. Arcesati said Huawei had lost a lot of ground in the wireless equipment market outside China, but those losses were concentrated in advanced economies that have restricted the company\'s role in their 5G network roll-outs, such as Australia and many European countries. ""As their governments\' national security concerns push the company away from these markets, the importance of Africa\'s developing and emerging economies to Chinese vendors is greater than ever,"" she said. Arcesati said the Huawei issue was not merely a case of an ICT firm reorienting its business strategy following some setbacks. The company is also China\'s national champion and the centrepiece of the government\'s plan to achieve global dominance in 5G. ""China\'s political and legal system is increasingly fuelling distrust of Chinese technology firms in Europe and elsewhere, a trend that will only deepen with the new data laws and the party-state\'s moves to strengthen control over private tech giants,"" she said. ""As a result, for Chinese leaders strengthening ties with developing and emerging economies in the digital economy is strategically vital."" \n \n\n © Provided by South China Morning Post Customers queue at a Huawei Technologies shop in Pretoria, South Africa. Photo: Bloomberg\n\n Since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak, China has been stressing digital economy cooperation with its partners in the global South at every virtual major regional summit, from FOCAC to Asean. ""There is a growing focus on promoting normative and regulatory alignment, particularly in the area of data governance,"" Arcesati said. ""China sees African countries as essential partners in the creation of a global rule book for the digital economy, one that more closely aligns with its preferences as opposed to a framework written by the West."" Xi plays up roles for private sector in China-Africa trade and finance According to Mishra, from the Observer Research Foundation, China\'s focus on Africa has also been driven by the setbacks in 5G and communications tech, not just in the US and Europe, but also India - which banned 59 Chinese apps - and Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines and Vietnam. ""African countries need to ensure they don\'t get embroiled between major power rivalries. The political fragmentation and commoditisation of the internet and broadband would be bad news,"" he said. But he added that it was also important to acknowledge the reality that Africa needed these technologies. ""Africa needs network infrastructure, and China is present and is responsible for making 70 per cent of the continent\'s network infrastructure. Africans also need affordable handsets and behold, China is making 50 per cent of the continent\'s handsets,"" Mishra said. Huawei is Africa\'s largest network provider while Transsion, maker of Tecno, Infinix and Itel brands, is the top seller of mobile phone handsets in the continent.

Let me begin byextending my warm congratulations on the opening of this year's\u2002meeting of the Advisory Council of the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. This year marks the eighth anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) put forth by President Xi Jinping. Recently, President Xi Jinping attended and delivered important remarks\u2002at the third\u2002symposium\u2002on Belt and Road development. He spoke highly of the fruitful achievements in Belt and Road cooperation over the past eight years, and set outclear requirements for the continued,\u2002high-quality development of Belt and Road cooperation.The past eight years\u2002have witnessed pioneering efforts.\u2002China and the cooperation partners, guided by the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, have achievedsolid\u2002and significant outcomesin high-quality Belt and Road cooperation with hard connectivity as the direction, soft connectivity as the support and people-to-people connectivity as the bond. The past eight years have also seen hard-won progress. China and the cooperation partnershave explored new opportunities despite the\u2002global recession, and deepened cooperation against\u2002protectionism, providing impetus for recoveryand growth in various countries\u2002and\u2002opening\u2002up space for international cooperation. To date, the BRI has become the world's largest platform for international cooperation. Friends,This year has been extraordinary in the journey of Belt and Road cooperation. Confronted by\u2002the global pandemic\u2002and a fluid international landscape, we have\u2002taken President Xi Jinping's proposal foran even closer Belt and Road partnership as our guide, and steadilyadvanced\u2002Belt and Road international cooperation. We have achieved a series of new progress and achievements, lending new impetus to the global efforts to fight the pandemic and protect people's well-being, and providing new underpinning for countries to boost cooperation and recover the economy. First, our practical cooperation has made steady progress.\u2002The China-Laos railway recently entered operation, and helps Laos realize its long-held dream ofturning from a land-locked to a land-linked country. The cross-sea bridge built with China-Croatia collaboration\u2002was successfully connected.Africa's\u2002tallest skyscraper was\u2002topped out. And construction of the main body of the Qatar World Cup main stadium was\u2002completed on schedule. In the first ten months\u2002of this year, China's investment in its cooperation partners grew by 14.6 percent, and their trade up by\u200223 percent. The China-Europe Railway Express completed 12,605 services and delivered 1.216 million TEUs of goods, up by 26 percent and 33 percent respectively year-on-year. With both the freight services and cargo volumes hitting record highs, the railway express has become\u2002a strong anchor of stability in the global supply chain. China has established e-commerce cooperation mechanisms with 22 countries, and its trade in cross-border e-commerce\u2002in\u2002the first half of this year rose by over 20 percent year-on-year, broadening the prospects for cooperation on Silk Road e-commerce. Second, the green Silk Road has shown great vitality.\u2002President Xi\u2002Jinping\u2002announced at the General Debate of the 76th Session of the UN General Assemblythat China will step up support for other developing countries in green and low-carbon energy development, and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad. Over the course ofthis year, severallarge wind power, hydro-power and other clean energy projectsjointly undertaken by China and relevant countries have started\u2002operation, and China is working with Saudi Arabia on the world's largest energy storage project. China and 31 cooperation partners jointly launched the Initiative for Belt and Road Partnership on Green Development, and the second Belt and Road Energy Ministerial Conference was\u2002successfully convened. Policy communication and practical cooperation on green and low-carbon development are advancing in a coordinated way, which\u2002have become the dual pillars of the green Silk Road.Third, the Silk Road of health has delivered remarkable progress. China has given strong support to other countries in their fight against COVID-19, providing anti-COVID supplies including vaccines, masks and protective suits on a continuous basis. Ninety percent of these supplies have gone to Belt and Road partner countries. This year, China and 31 cooperation partners jointly launched the Initiative for Belt and Road Partnership on COVID-19 Vaccines Cooperation, and championed closer cooperation on\u2002vaccine export, assistance, joint production, technology transfer and other areas,to build a Great Wall against COVID-19. To date, China has provided nearly 2 billion doses of vaccines to over 120 countries and international organizations, accounting for one third of all vaccines administered worldwide minus China. Chinese companies have worked with 19 developing country partners on joint vaccine production,and developed an initial annual capacity of over one billion doses. With concrete practices on the ground, China's promise of making the vaccines a public good is becoming a reality.Fourth, the cooperation network has grown more sophisticated. This year, another seven countries signed Belt and Road cooperation documents with China, raising the number of BRI family members to 145. Last June, the Asia and Pacific High-level Conference on Belt and Road Cooperation was successfully held. The 30 participating countries made a joint call for fighting\u2002the pandemic\u2002in unity, speeding\u2002up a green transition and boosting\u2002sustainable recovery of the world economy. More than 40 meetings were held under Belt and Road multilateral cooperation frameworks this year, covering\u2002green development, taxation, energy, finance, disaster relief, think tanks, media, culture and arts. Chinese\u2002provinces and cities\u2002hosted a string\u2002of Belt and Road-themed events based on\u2002their respective strengths and distinctive features. In a word, Belt\u2002and Road exchanges and cooperation in various fields have been flourishing with many highlights.Experience over the past year once again shows that BRI\u2002cooperation has not stopped because of\u2002COVID-19; on the contrary, it has become a road of hope that bolsters\u2002resilience and boosts confidence. The BRI has never been a geopolitical strategy, but a road of development that helps deliver the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and drives shared progress and prosperity. Moreover, the BRI has not created the so-called 'debt trap', but serves as a road of opportunity that delivers mutual benefit. The BRI will not damage the environment, but is a green road that facilitates low-carbon growth, environmental protection and climate response.Friends,Our world is facing the combined impacts of a pandemic and major changes unseen in a century, and the global recovery has come to a critical juncture. President Xi Jinping made it clear that the BRI needs to aim at high-standard, sustainable and people-centered growth, consolidate the basis for connectivity cooperation, open up\u2002new space for international cooperation, and work\u2002for higher-standard cooperation, better deliverables from inputs, higher-quality supply and stronger resilience in development. With that in mind, China hopes\u2002to work together with all partners on the following fronts:First, upholding\u2002a people-centered philosophy of cooperation.\u2002Meeting our people's aspiration for a better life is why we started the BRI in the first place. We will continue to focus on economic growth, job creation, livelihood protection and poverty reduction, and deepen practical cooperation with partner countries in the economic, trade, health, poverty reduction, education and agricultural fields. We will develop\u2002more cooperation projects that improve people's lives,todeliver more real gains to people\u2002across the\u2002partner countries. China\u2002will continue to carry out anti-COVIDcooperation with other parties. We will\u2002fulfill our commitments announced by President Xi Jinpingof providing another one billion doses of COVID vaccines to Africa and donating an additional 150 million doses to ASEAN countries. We will deepen cooperation with other developing countries on the joint production of vaccines for an early victory over COVID-19 and help bring life back to normal across countries at an early date.Second, following\u2002the cooperation principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. The BRI is the common cause of all our partners. China will step up policy communication with other parties, pursue a coordinated approach to COVID response and BRI cooperation, work with our partners on the funding support, supporting services and security safeguards of cooperation projects, and\u2002share\u2002responsibilities, risks and benefits. We need to improve bilateral, trilateral and multilateral cooperation mechanisms to make the BRI global partnership network more solid, more substantive and more productive. Following the principles of openness, inclusiveness and transparency, China welcomes more countries and institutions to join tripartite or multiparty cooperation under the BRI.Recently, some countries have proposed new initiatives of international infrastructurecooperationand a regional economic framework. In China's view, the yardstick in judging an initiative should be whether it puts development first, whether it is open and inclusive, whether it pursues mutual benefit, and whether it is action-oriented. Any attempt to sever ties among\u2002countries and the industrial and supply chains, form exclusive blocs, or even draw lines along ideology and stoke political confrontation runs counter to the trend of history and is bound to be rejected\u2002by history. Here, I wish to\u2002reiterate\u2002that\u2002China welcomes and is open to all cooperation initiatives that are truly beneficial to enhancing\u2002connectivity, boosting\u2002economic growth, improving people's well-being\u2002and advancing\u2002social progress. China is prepared to communicate\u2002and\u2002cooperate\u2002with such initiatives to expand complementarity and forge synergy.Third,\u2002keeping\u2002to the direction of high-quality and high-standard cooperation.\u2002Belt and Road cooperation has entered the new stage of high-quality development. We will align with the widely accepted international rules and standards\u2002more proactively, carry out more high-quality projects, shape\u2002more best practices, and make sure thatprojects are sustainable economically, fiscally, financially and environmentally. We will build up connectivity with other countries, and keep global supply and industrial chains stable and smooth with joint efforts. We welcome the participation of more countries in the Initiative for Belt and Road Partnership on Green Development\u2002to pursue deeper cooperation on\u2002green infrastructure, green energy, green investment and green finance. We will accelerate efforts to fuel Belt and Road cooperation with digital technology, and generate more deliverables in the areas of 5G, big data and cross-border e-commerce, to help developing countries bridge the digital divide. We will continue to tackle corruption with zero tolerance, and keep\u2002the Silk Roadclean and transparent.Fourth, embracing\u2002the vision of cooperation for common development around the world.\u2002Pursuing sustainable development and delivering the UN 2030 Agenda are innate goals of the BRI cooperation. We will continue to take the BRI\u2002forward as part of the global development cause, and pursue economic, social\u2002and ecological\u2002development in a coordinated manner. Through Belt and Road cooperation, we seek to help other developing countries, especiallythe least developed ones, in their efforts to reduce poverty, and make\u2002the BRI a pathway to poverty alleviation for developing countries. China's\u2002new development paradigm will unleash the huge\u2002vitality and potential of the big Chinese market, bringing more market and development opportunities to our\u2002BRI partners. The Global Development Initiative President Xi Jinping put forth last September aims to promote international cooperation in the eight areas of poverty alleviation, food security, COVID-19 response and vaccines, development financing, climate change and green development, industrialization, digital economy and connectivity. The Initiative is very much along the lineof the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and seeks more robust, greener and more balanced global development. This Initiative and the BRI may complement and reinforce each other to generate\u2002greater synergy for advancing common\u2002development.Friends,This year marks the centenary of the founding of the Communist Party of China\u2002(CPC). One important piece of experience the CPC has gained in leading the Chinese people in the 100-year struggle isto embrace a global vision, both seeking happiness for the Chinese people and contributing to the shared progress of the world. We will stay committed to peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, the common values of humanity. We will stay committed to openness and mutual benefit, and away from isolation and zero-sum game, and provide impetus to the building of a community with a shared future for mankind through high-quality Belt and Road cooperation.The BRF Advisory Council has lent important intellectual support to Belt and Road international cooperation. The Council issued its\u2002first report in 2019,\u2002and many of the recommendations therein have been adopted. I am happy to see the Council will release\u2002a new report today, which presents\u2002its findings and suggestionsbased on\u2002the BRI's new developments and new circumstances. We will earnestly study and make the most of the report, and hope that\u2002the\u2002Council will bring more wisdom and inputs\u2002to the high-quality Belt and Road cooperation.To conclude, I wish the meeting a full success."", 'Members of the Advisory Council, Friends, Good evening.

In the first 10 months, bilateral trade between China and ASEAN increased by 7 percent year on year to 3.79 trillion yuan (about 571.64 billion U.S. dollars), accounting for 14.6 percent of China\'s foreign trade, according to China\'s General Administration of Customs. This year\'s expo also highlights the RCEP, the world\'s biggest trade pact, which was signed earlier this month by 15 Asia-Pacific countries, including ASEAN\'s 10 member states and China. It was a massive move for regional economic integration, multilateralism and free trade. ""I believe that the RCEP will also provide a solid foundation for an open, inclusive, and rules-based global trade environment,"" said Myanmar President U Win Myint at the expo\'s opening ceremony. Xu Ningning, executive president of the China-ASEAN Business Council, said that opening up the markets of the 15 countries to each other will bring about new changes and closer regional cooperation. PROMOTING DIGITAL ECONOMY Stressing the need to deepen cooperation on the digital economy, Xi said China and ASEAN could create more highlights of cooperation in such areas as smart cities, 5G, artificial intelligence, e-commerce, big data, blockchain and telemedicine, and strengthen the protection of data security and policy communication and coordination. China will work with ASEAN on the China-ASEAN Information Harbor to advance digital connectivity and build a digital Silk Road, he added. The added value of China\'s digital economy registered 35.8 trillion yuan in 2019, accounting for 36.2 percent of the country\'s GDP, up 1.4 percentage points from the previous year, according to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology. ""China is one of the countries that are at the forefront in developing, investing and utilizing digital technology in the world. In this regard, advancing cooperation in the area of digital technology, under the Belt and Road Initiative, will be an important agenda in the future,"" said Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen via video at the expo\'s opening ceremony. It is estimated that ASEAN\'s digital economy will increase from 1.3 percent of the group\'s GDP in 2015 to 8.5 percent in 2025, according to ASEAN Secretary-General Lim Jock Hoi. Myanmar President U Win Myint said that the digital economy is an important segment of sustainable development, ""especially at a time when we are becoming increasingly reliant on digital technology for communication, education, health care, trade, investment, stock exchange, and other forms of business activities in the face of challenges posed by the global pandemic."" ""We should also continue to encourage the exchange and transfer of modern technological know-how in order to facilitate a transition to the digital economy,"" said Lao Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith. CLOSER COOPERATION AGAINST COVID-19 President Xi said the two sides also need to strengthen cooperation against COVID-19 and enhance capacity building in public health. China stands ready to work with ASEAN to enhance policy dialogue on public health, information sharing and cooperation on the production, development, and deployment of vaccines, Xi said. ""The COVID-19 crisis has made us realize the importance of friendship and international cooperation even more. We have witnessed weaknesses that need to be improved and strengths that need to be further enhanced and developed,"" Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said via video at the ceremony. The crisis caused by the pandemic bears testimony to the greater need to uphold the principles of multilateralism and to strengthen international cooperation, said Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen.

Xi Jinping\n\n\nPresident of the People\'s Republic of China\n\n\nAt the China-Central Asia Summit\n\n\n19 May 2023\n\n\nDistinguished Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends,\n\n\nI\'d like to welcome you all to Xi\'an for the China-Central Asia Summit to explore together ways for closer cooperation between China and the five Central Asian countries.\n\n\nXi\'an, known as Chang\'an in ancient times, is an important cradle of the Chinese civilization and nation. It is also the starting point of the ancient Silk Road on the east end. Over 2,100 years ago, Zhang Qian, a Han Dynasty envoy, made his journey to the West from Chang\'an, opening the door to the friendship and exchanges between China and Central Asia. With their joint endeavor of hundreds of years, Chinese and Central Asian peoples made the Silk Road expand and prosper, a historic contribution to the interaction, integration, enrichment and development of world civilizations. The Tang Dynasty poet Li Bai once wrote, ""In Chang\'an we meet again, worthy of more than a thousand pieces of gold."" Our gathering in Xi\'an today to renew our millennia-old friendship and open up new vistas for the future is of very important significance.\n\n\nBack in 2013, I put forward the initiative of jointly building a Silk Road Economic Belt during my first visit to Central Asia as Chinese president. Over the past decade, China and Central Asian countries have worked closely together to fully revive the Silk Road and actively deepen future-oriented cooperation, steering our relations into a new era.\n\n\nThe China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan highway that runs across the Tianshan Mountain, the China-Tajikistan expressway that defies the Pamir Plateau, and the China-Kazakhstan crude oil pipeline and the China-Central Asia Gas Pipeline that traverse the vast desert -- they are the present-day Silk Road. The China-Europe Railway Express operating around the clock, the endless streams of freight trucks, and crisscrossing flights -- they are the present-day camel caravans. Entrepreneurs seeking business opportunities, health workers fighting the COVID-19, cultural workers delivering message of friendship, and international students pursuing further education -- they are the present-day goodwill ambassadors.\n\n\nThe China-Central Asia relationship is steeped in history, driven by broad actual needs, and built on solid popular support. Our relations are brimming with vigor and vitality in the new era.\n\n\nColleagues,\n\n\nTransformations of the world unseen in a century are unfolding at a faster pace. Changes of the world, of our times, and of the historical trajectory are taking place in ways like never before. Central Asia, the center of the Eurasian continent, is at a crossroads connecting the East and West, the South and North.\n\n\nThe world needs a stable Central Asia. The sovereignty, security, independence and territorial integrity of Central Asian countries must be upheld; their people\'s choice of development paths must be respected; and their efforts for peace, harmony and tranquility must be supported.\n\n\nThe world needs a prosperous Central Asia. A dynamic and prospering Central Asia will help people in the region achieve their aspiration for a better life. It will also lend strong impetus to global economic recovery.\n\n\nThe world needs a harmonious Central Asia. As a Central Asian saying goes, ""Brotherhood is more precious than any treasure."" Ethnic conflicts, religious strife, and cultural estrangement are not the defining feature of the region. Instead, solidarity, inclusiveness, and harmony are the pursuits of the Central Asian people. No one has the right to sow discord or stoke confrontation in the region, let alone seek selfish political interests.\n\n\nThe world needs an interconnected Central Asia. Blessed with unique geographical advantages, Central Asia has the right foundation, condition and capability to become an important connectivity hub of Eurasia and make unique contribution to the trading of goods, the interplay of civilizations and the development of science and technology in the world.\n\n\nColleagues,\n\n\nAt the virtual summit commemorating the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Central Asian countries held last year, we jointly announced our vision of a China-Central Asia community with a shared future. It was a historic choice made for the fundamental interests and bright future of our peoples in the new era. In building this community, we need to stay committed to four principles.\n\n\nFirst, mutual assistance. It is important that we deepen strategic mutual trust, and always give each other unequivocal and strong support on issues concerning our core interests such as sovereignty, independence, national dignity, and long-term development. We should work together to ensure that our community features mutual assistance, solidarity, and mutual trust.\n\n\nSecond, common development. It is important that we continue to set the pace for Belt and Road cooperation and deliver on the Global Development Initiative. We should fully unlock our potentials in traditional areas of cooperation such as economy, trade, industrial capacity, energy and transportation. And we should forge new drivers of growth in finance, agriculture, poverty reduction, green and low-carbon development, medical service, health, and digital innovation. We should work together to ensure that our community features win-win cooperation and common progress.\n\n\nThird, universal security. It is important that we act on the Global Security Initiative, and stand firm against external attempts to interfere in domestic affairs of regional countries or instigate color revolutions. We should remain zero-tolerant to the three forces of terrorism, separatism and extremism, and strive to resolve security conundrums in the region. We should work together to ensure that our community features no-conflict and enduring peace.\n\n\nFourth, everlasting friendship. It is important that we implement the Global Civilization Initiative, carry forward our traditional friendship, and enhance people-to-people exchanges. We should do more to share our experience in governance, deepen cultural mutual learning, increase mutual understanding, and cement the foundation of the everlasting friendship between the Chinese and Central Asian peoples. We should work together to ensure that our community features close affinity and shared conviction.\n\n\nColleagues,\n\n\nOur Summit has created a new platform and opened up new prospects for China-Central Asia cooperation. China will take this as an opportunity to step up coordination with all parties for good planning, development and progress of China-Central Asia cooperation.\n\n\nFirst, we need to strengthen institutional building. We have set up meeting mechanisms on foreign affairs, economy, trade and customs, as well as a business council. China has also proposed establishment of meeting and dialogue mechanisms on industry and investment, agriculture, transportation, emergency response, education, and political parties, which will be platforms for all-round mutually beneficial cooperation between our countries.\n\n\nSecond, we need to expand economic and trade ties. China will take more trade facilitation measures, upgrade bilateral investment treaties, and open ""green lanes"" for streamlined customs clearance of agricultural and sideline products at all border ports between China and Central Asian countries. China will also hold a live-streaming sales event to further promote Central Asian products, and build a commodities trading center. All this is part of an effort to push two-way trade to new heights.\n\n\nThird, we need to deepen connectivity. China will strive to increase the volume of cross-border cargo transportation, support the development of the trans-Caspian international transport corridor, enhance the traffic capacity of the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan highway and the China-Tajikistan-Uzbekistan highway, and move forward consultations on the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway. China will seek to modernize the existing border ports at a faster pace, open a new border port at Biedieli, promote the opening of the air transportation market, and build a regional logistics network. China will also step up the development of China-Europe Railway Express assembly centers, encourage capable enterprises to build overseas warehouses in Central Asian countries, and build a comprehensive digital service platform.\n\n\nFourth, we need to expand energy cooperation. China would like to propose that we establish a China-Central Asia energy development partnership. We should expedite the construction of Line D of the China-Central Asia Gas Pipeline, expand trade in oil and gas, pursue cooperation throughout the energy industrial chains, and strengthen cooperation on new energy and peaceful use of nuclear energy.\n\n\nFifth, we need to promote green innovation. China will work with Central Asian countries to conduct cooperation in such areas as improvement and utilization of saline-alkali land and water-saving irrigation, build together a joint laboratory on agriculture in arid lands, and tackle the ecological crisis of the Aral Sea. China supports establishing high-tech firms and IT industrial parks in Central Asia. China also welcomes Central Asian countries to participate in special cooperation programs under the Belt and Road Initiative, including programs on sustainable development technologies, innovation and start-up, and spatial information science and technology.\n\n\nSixth, we need to enhance capabilities for development. China will formulate a China-Central Asia special cooperation program for poverty reduction through science and technology, implement the ""China-Central Asia technology and skills improvement scheme"", set up more Luban Workshops in Central Asian countries, and encourage Chinese companies in Central Asia to create more local jobs. To bolster our cooperation and Central Asian development, China will provide Central Asian countries with a total of 26 billion RMB yuan of financing support and grant.\n\n\nSeventh, we need to strengthen dialogue between civilizations. China invites Central Asian countries to take part in the ""Cultural Silk Road"" program, and will set up more traditional medicine centers in Central Asia. We will speed up establishment of cultural centers in each other\'s countries. China will continue to provide government scholarships for Central Asian countries, and support their universities in joining the University Alliance of the Silk Road. We will ensure the success of the Year of Culture and Arts for the Peoples of China and Central Asian Countries as well as the China-Central Asia high-level media dialogue. We will launch the ""China-Central Asia Cultural and Tourism Capital"" program, and open special train services for cultural tourism in Central Asia.\n\n\nEighth, we need to safeguard peace in the region. China is ready to help Central Asian countries strengthen capacity building on law enforcement, security and defense, support their independent efforts to safeguard regional security and fight terrorism, and work with them to promote cyber-security. We will continue to leverage the role of the coordination mechanism among Afghanistan\'s neighbors, and jointly promote peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan.\n\n\nColleagues,\n\n\nLast October, the Communist Party of China successfully held its 20th National Congress, which laid out the central task of realizing the Second Centenary Goal of building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects and advancing rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization. It is a grand blueprint for China\'s future development. We will strengthen theoretical and practical exchanges with Central Asian countries on modernization, synergize our development strategies, create more opportunities for cooperation, and jointly advance the modernization process of our six countries.\n\n\nColleagues,\n\n\nThere is a proverb popular among farmers in Shaanxi Province, ""If you work hard enough, gold will grow out of the land."" In the same vein, a Central Asian saying goes, ""You get rewarded if you give, and you harvest if you sow."" Let us work closely together to pursue common development, common affluence, and common prosperity, and embrace a brighter future for our six countries!\n\n\nThank you.', 'XI\'AN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday delivered a keynote speech at the China-Central Asia Summit held in the city of Xi\'an, northwest China\'s Shaanxi Province.\n \nThe following is the full text of the speech:\n \nWorking Together for a China-Central Asia Community with a Shared Future\n \nFeaturing Mutual Assistance, Common Development, Universal Security, and Everlasting Friendship\n \nKeynote Speech by H.E.

China also welcomes Central Asian countries to participate in special cooperation programs under the Belt and Road Initiative, including programs on sustainable development technologies, innovation and start-up, and spatial information science and technology.\nSixth, we need to enhance capabilities for development. China will formulate a China-Central Asia special cooperation program for poverty reduction through science and technology, implement the ""China-Central Asia technology and skills improvement scheme"", set up more Luban Workshops in Central Asian countries, and encourage Chinese companies in Central Asia to create more local jobs. To bolster our cooperation and Central Asian development, China will provide Central Asian countries with a total of 26 billion RMB yuan of financing support and grant.\nSeventh, we need to strengthen dialogue between civilizations. China invites Central Asian countries to take part in the ""Cultural Silk Road"" program, and will set up more traditional medicine centers in Central Asia. We will speed up establishment of cultural centers in each other\'s countries. China will continue to provide government scholarships for Central Asian countries, and support their universities in joining the University Alliance of the Silk Road. We will ensure the success of the Year of Culture and Arts for the Peoples of China and Central Asian Countries as well as the China-Central Asia high-level media dialogue. We will launch the ""China-Central Asia Cultural and Tourism Capital"" program, and open special train services for cultural tourism in Central Asia.\nEighth, we need to safeguard peace in the region. China is ready to help Central Asian countries strengthen capacity building on law enforcement, security and defense, support their independent efforts to safeguard regional security and fight terrorism, and work with them to promote cyber-security. We will continue to leverage the role of the coordination mechanism among Afghanistan\'s neighbors, and jointly promote peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan.\nColleagues,\nLast October, the Communist Party of China successfully held its 20th National Congress, which laid out the central task of realizing the Second Centenary Goal of building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects and advancing rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization. It is a grand blueprint for China\'s future development. We will strengthen theoretical and practical exchanges with Central Asian countries on modernization, synergize our development strategies, create more opportunities for cooperation, and jointly advance the modernization process of our six countries.\nColleagues,\nThere is a proverb popular among farmers in Shaanxi Province, ""If you work hard enough, gold will grow out of the land."" In the same vein, a Central Asian saying goes, ""You get rewarded if you give, and you harvest if you sow."" Let us work closely together to pursue common development, common affluence, and common prosperity, and embrace a brighter future for our six countries!\nThank you.\xa0 \n■']"

(Xinhua/Huang Jingwen)\n\n\nXI\'AN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday hailed the new era of China-Central Asia relations and announced a slew of proposals and measures to strengthen their cooperation, as he chaired a high-profile summit in the northwestern city of Xi\'an, Shaanxi Province.\n\n\nChina and Central Asian countries have joined hands over the past decade to usher in a new era of their relations, Xi said while delivering a keynote speech at the China-Central Asia Summit, the first in-person summit attended by heads of state of China and the five Central Asian countries, namely Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.\n\n\nThe relations between China and Central Asian countries have great vigor and vitality in the new era, Xi said.\n\n\nHighlighting the important geographic location of the region, Xi said the world needs a Central Asia that is stable, prosperous, harmonious and well-connected.\n\n\nThe sovereignty, security, independence and territorial integrity of Central Asian countries must be safeguarded, the development paths independently chosen by Central Asian people must be respected, and the efforts made by the region to pursue peace, amity and tranquility must be supported, he noted.\n\n\n""No one has the right to sow discord or stoke confrontation in the region, let alone seek selfish political interests,"" Xi said, adding that the region has the right foundation, condition and capability to become an important connectivity hub of Eurasia and make unique contribution to the trading of goods, the interplay of civilizations and the development of science and technology in the world.\n\n\nFrom Wednesday to Thursday, Xi met or held talks with Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon, Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev and Turkmen President Serdar Berdimuhamedov.\n\n\nSpeaking to Xi, the Central Asian leaders expressed their confidence and resolve to strengthen cooperation with China and pursue common development.\n\n\nIn Xi\'an, the historical starting point of the ancient Silk Road, Xi held a banquet for the leaders Thursday evening in the Tang Paradise, a complex based on the site of the original relic of an imperial garden dating back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907).\n\n\nIn 2013, Xi put forward the initiative of jointly building a Silk Road Economic Belt in Kazakhstan, which was met with enthusiastic response and active participation from Central Asian countries.\n\n\nOver the past decade, the joint development of the Belt and Road Initiative between China and Central Asian countries has yielded fruitful results, playing an exemplary role in Eurasia and even in the international community.\n \nCHINA-CENTRAL ASIA COMMUNITY WITH SHARED FUTURE\n\n\nIn his keynote speech at the summit, Xi said that to build a China-Central Asia community with a shared future, efforts should be made to stay committed to the four principles of mutual assistance, common development, universal security, and everlasting friendship.\n\n\nChina and Central Asian countries should deepen strategic mutual trust, and always offer clear and strong support to each other on issues of core interests such as those involving sovereignty, independence, national dignity and long-term development, he said.\n\n\nXi called on the six countries to continue to set the pace for Belt and Road cooperation, to fully unlock the potentials in traditional areas of cooperation such as economy, trade, industrial capacity, energy and transportation, and to forge new drivers of growth in finance, agriculture, poverty reduction, green and low-carbon development, medical service, health, and digital innovation.\n\n\nThe six countries should resolutely oppose external interference in the internal affairs of regional countries and attempts to instigate ""color revolutions,"" and maintain a zero-tolerance stance against the ""three forces"" of terrorism, separatism and extremism, he said.\n\n\nThey should carry forward their traditional friendship, enhance people-to-people exchanges, do more to share their experience in governance, deepen cultural mutual learning, and increase mutual understanding, he added.\n \nCLOSER COOPERATION\n\n\nThe summit has been lauded for creating a new platform and opening up new prospects for China-Central Asia cooperation.\n\n\nIn his speech, Xi made an eight-point proposal for strengthening cooperation, ranging from expanding economic ties to promoting cultural exchanges and safeguarding regional peace.\n\n\nChina proposes the establishment of meeting and dialogue mechanisms on industry and investment, agriculture, transportation, emergency response, education, and political parties, Xi said.\n\n\nMore trade facilitation measures will be rolled out and bilateral investment treaties will be upgraded to push two-way trade to new heights, he said, pledging to support the development of the trans-Caspian international transport corridor and encourage capable enterprises to build overseas warehouses in Central Asian countries.\n\n\nChina will formulate a cooperation program for poverty reduction through science and technology, Xi said. Chinese companies in Central Asian countries will be encouraged to create more local jobs. China will provide Central Asian countries with a total of 26 billion yuan (about 3.7 billion U.S. dollars) in financing support and grants.\n\n\nChina is ready to help Central Asian countries strengthen capacity building on law enforcement, security and defense in an effort to safeguard peace in the region, Xi said, adding that efforts should be made to leverage the role of the coordination mechanism among Afghanistan\'s neighbors, and jointly promote peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan.\n \nSUMMIT MECHANISM\n\n\nSpeaking at the summit, the Central Asian leaders thanked China for proposing and successfully hosting the first China-Central Asia Summit.\n\n\nChina has become a key force in safeguarding global security and stability and promoting sci-tech and economic development, and cooperation with China is indispensable for countries to achieve sustainable development, the leaders said.\n\n\nLauding the summit for steering China-Central Asia relations into a new era, they vowed to better coordinate the development strategies of their respective countries with the Belt and Road Initiative, and to join hands to cope with challenges and achieve win-win cooperation.\n\n\nXi and presidents of the five Central Asian countries signed the Xi\'an Declaration of the China-Central Asia Summit and adopted a list of summit outcomes.\n\n\nThey also announced a decision to officially inaugurate the China-Central Asia Summit Mechanism, with the two sides taking turns to host the biennial summit.

9,38,9_chinese_bri_debt_financial,BRI Dept Trap,"['chinese', 'bri', 'debt', 'financial', 'china', 'loans', 'countries', 'projects', 'road', 'belt']","['Hong Kong, June 12 (ANI): When \n\n\'s President \n\n floated the \n\n (\n\n) in 2013, it was unclear what it actually entailed. Perhaps Xi did not know either, for there was not even consensus on its name - it was originally labelled the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, and then One Belt, One Road.\nThe \n\n became a blue-ribbon project for Xi. Thus, his and, by extension, \n\n\'s prestige became dependent on its success. Now, ten years on, \n\n has had to tighten its belt and divert the road in new directions to keep the whole concept alive.\nConsequently, \n\n announced three new initiatives in 2021-22 and, although still rather vague, these are directed at gaining greater influence over the Global South, accelerating the perception of US decline, and promoting \n\n\'s warped perspective of international order.\nAs Xi promotes his twisted form of obstreperous \n\n-centric security designed to usurp the West, the Asia-Pacific region especially will increasingly become a battleground of ideologies.\n\n is the world\'s largest private lender, yet nearly 60 per cent of Chinese overseas loanstoday are held by countries considered financially distressed. To put this in context, in 2010 this figure was just 5 per cent.\n\n\'s \n\n plight has been magnified by COVID-19 and the Ukraine war. Indeed, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine accounted for 20 per cent of \n\n\'s overseas lending over the past two decades. \n\n\'s lending boom has truly ended, plus struggling countries like Pakistan are asking for debt restructuring.\nThe \n\n peaked in 2018, five years ago. Although \n\n is globally pushing its own take on security, development and digital governance, \n\n is also, to a certain extent turning its focus inwards, returning to a centuries-old practice of retreating within its borders.\n\n\'s narrative was that the \n\n would increase connectivity and infrastructure. Indeed, \n\n listed five priorities: coordinating policy; improving connectivity; reducing impediments to trade; integrating financial structures; and building people-to-people ties through exchanges/dialogues.\nHowever, it rapidly morphed into a hydra where absolutely any overseas project was subsumed under its umbrella. Around 2016, Chinese investment in rail, road, port and pipeline projects boomed, but \n\n\'s economic woes have slowed down such efforts since 2018/19. There is also a noticeable trend from hard infrastructure projects towards digital infrastructure ones.\nIndeed, the \n\n\'s future seems to rest on the Digital Silk Road (DSR), launched in 2015. As another tangent, the ""Health Silk Road"" projects intensified in 2020 as \n\n exported COVID-19 vaccines and medical supplies.\nInitially, \n\n investment was directed towards Central Asia and Southeast Asia, before spreading westward and into Africa. Since 2018, Latin America and the South Pacific received a lot of attention. However, South Asia and Southeast Asia ultimately emerged as the main foci.\nEarlier this month, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) issued its annual Asia-Pacific Regional Security Assessment. Meia Nouwens, Senior Fellow for Chinese Security and Defense Policy at IISS, contributed a chapter entitled \n\n\'s \n\n a Decade on.\nNouwens discussed the implications for four key regions. Beginning in Southeast Asia, she said this region will remain Beijing\'s chief area of strategic importance. \n\n has been ASEAN\'s largest trading partner since 2009, and the bloc has been \n\n\'s largest trading partner since 2020. Maritime routes run through Southeast Asian chokepoints too, encouraging \n\n to push railways as an alternative.\nKey recipients have been Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, the Philippines and Vietnam. Naturally, \n\n wants Southeast Asia to be non-aligned, to serve as a bulwark against American influence.\nHowever, \n\n is not doing itself any favours with continual harassment of Philippine and Vietnamese commercial and law enforcement activities in the South \n\n Sea. Western countries are leery of adopting Chinese 5G telecommunication networks, but this is not the case in many developing countries.\nNonetheless, as \n\n exerts tighter control over domestic private-sector technology companies, this will complicate their ability to execute projects overseas. The USA\'s stricter regulation of semiconductor and microchip technologies will also complicate \n\n\'s ambitions.\nAccording to Nouwens, fear of economic dependency, ethnic tensions, project build quality and corporate social responsibility remain troubling issues for \n\n. Ethnic tensions often result from beliefs that Chinese-led projects benefit migrant workers rather than the local population. In Indonesia, for instance, Chinese guest workers rose from 17,515 in 2015 to 30,000 in 2018.\nConsidering the South Asia region, unsurprisingly it is Pakistan that has received the lion\'s share of \n\n investment, absorbing more than half the money. \n\n\'s heavy investment in road, rail and pipeline infrastructure through the Himalayas as part of the \n\n-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is not paying economic dividends, however.\nIndeed, it is far more expensive to transport products overland through Pakistan than by traditional sea routes. For instance, if shifting 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day via the Burma-\n\n pipeline, and 250,000 barrels daily through the Pakistan-\n\n pipeline, \n\n would lose approximately USD1 billion per year compared to the traditional seaborne tanker route.\nAnother estimate predicts that shipping oil from the Persian Gulf to \n\n\'s east coast would cost USD2 per barrel, whereas it would cost USD15 per barrel via the Pakistan overland pipeline. Nouwens commented, ""The \n\n in South Asia has achieved its intended goal of\nexporting Chinese industrial overcapacity abroad. From 2010-18, for example, the value of Chinese industrial goods exports to Pakistan increased from USD3.1 billion to USD8.2 billion. Nevertheless, South Asian \n\n projects have faced security, political, economic, geographic and governance challenges.""Furthermore, ""Chinese investments in the region have not necessarily created more favourable conditions for Beijing\'s influence. Chinese investment in South Asia has been one factor encouraging India to align more closely with the West, notably through the Quad.""\n \nAs for Central Asia, boosting ties there is helping \n\n develop its own poorer western provinces. From 2016-21, annual \n\n-Europe freight train journeys snowballed from 1,702 to 15,183.\nNonetheless, most trade between \n\n and Europe still travels by sea (95+ per cent in Germany\'s case), and the Ukraine war has led to a 34 per cent drop in volume via the northern rail corridor.\nIn the South Pacific region, Australia, New Zealand and the USA are very concerned about Chinese interests encroaching, especially since a 2018 uptick. One example is last year\'s Solomon Islands-\n\n security agreement. Nonetheless, this oceanic region attracts only a tiny proportion of \n\n funds, with the largest beneficiaries being Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.\nNouwens concluded, ""Despite Chinese loans and grants to the sub-region, \n\n and the \n\n have made only a minimal impact in recipient Pacific Island states. There has not been any significant shift in Chinese investment or trade towards the sub-region, with the exception of Papua New Guinea. Exports from \n\n to the South Pacific have increased twelvefold in value between 2000 and 2018, though the numbers for exports from Pacific Island countries to \n\n have grown at a much less impressive rate.""\nSamoa, Tonga and Vanuatu are the most indebted islands to \n\n, with Tonga owing about 25 per cent of its annual GDP to the Export-Import Bank of \n\n. Interestingly, only Solomon Islands and Kiribati signed up for new Chinese loans between 2017 and 2021.\nBy 2021, 64 per cent of \n\n projects in Southeast Asia, the South Pacific and South Asiahad been completed, according to Nouwen\'s research. A further 22 per cent of projects were ongoing, and the remaining 14 per cent were still in the planning stage.\nThe \n\n, therefore, looks rosy, right? Yet Nouwens pointed out, ""...Judging implementation against these metrics risks overlooking both the fact that the last decade of \n\n implementation has in some ways proved to be chaotic, and also the question of recipient countries\' agency. The \n\n\'s rollout in the last ten years has lacked central bureaucratic oversight and control or a coherent implementation strategy.""\nThe \n\n was initially run under vague action plans, with existing projects simply rebadged as \n\n ones. As Nouwens noted, ""The reality of the \n\n is that propaganda exceeds implementation, activity overtakes purpose, and actors further down the hierarchy have much latitude in interpreting the terms of their involvement. Instead of being seen as effective tools of statecraft, the \n\n and DSR should perhaps be viewed as tools of the \n\n\'s \'party craft\'.""\nFor this reason, the \n\n has not had the widespread impact that many Western leaders feared during its peak in 2016. ""Importantly, the idea of debt-trap diplomacy turned out to be unproven, and \n\n\'s investment in nearly 60 ports worldwide has not - contrary to the expressed fears of some commentators - provided it with immediate access to a global network of dual-use ports, let alone naval bases,"" the IISS researcher concluded.\nElsewhere, Lee Jones and Shahar Hameiri, in a Chatham House August 2020 research paper entitled ""Debunking the Myth of Debt-Trap Diplomacy"", concluded ""that the \n\n is, in fact, motivated largely by economic factors.

As with \n\n, it is a case of buyer beware for every initiative that \n\n dreams up. (ANI)', 'When China\'s President Xi Jinping floated the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013, it was unclear what it actually entailed. Perhaps Xi did not know either, for there was not even consensus on its name - it was originally labelled the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, and then One Belt, One Road. The BRI became a blue-ribbon project for Xi. Thus, his and, by extension, China\'s prestige became dependent on its success. Now, ten years on, China has had to tighten its belt and divert the road in new directions to keep the whole concept alive.\nConsequently, China announced three new initiatives in 2021-22 and, although still rather vague, these are directed at gaining greater influence over the Global South, accelerating the perception of US decline, and promoting China\'s warped perspective of international order. As Xi promotes his twisted form of obstreperous China-centric security designed to usurp the West, the Asia-Pacific region especially will increasingly become a battleground of ideologies.\nChina is the world\'s largest private lender, yet nearly 60 per cent of Chinese overseas loanstoday are held by countries considered financially distressed. To put this in context, in 2010 this figure was just 5 per cent. China\'s BRI plight has been magnified by COVID-19 and the Ukraine war. Indeed, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine accounted for 20 per cent of China\'s overseas lending over the past two decades. China\'s lending boom has truly ended, plus struggling countries like Pakistan are asking for debt restructuring.\nThe BRI peaked in 2018, five years ago. Although China is globally pushing its own take on security, development and digital governance, China is also, to a certain extent turning its focus inwards, returning to a centuries-old practice of retreating within its borders. China\'s narrative was that the BRI would increase connectivity and infrastructure. Indeed, China listed five priorities: coordinating policy; improving connectivity; reducing impediments to trade; integrating financial structures; and building people-to-people ties through exchanges/dialogues.\nHowever, it rapidly morphed into a hydra where absolutely any overseas project was subsumed under its umbrella. Around 2016, Chinese investment in rail, road, port and pipeline projects boomed, but China\'s economic woes have slowed down such efforts since 2018/19. There is also a noticeable trend from hard infrastructure projects towards digital infrastructure ones. Indeed, the BRI\'s future seems to rest on the Digital Silk Road (DSR), launched in 2015. As another tangent, the ""Health Silk Road"" projects intensified in 2020 as China exported COVID-19 vaccines and medical supplies.\nInitially, BRI investment was directed towards Central Asia and Southeast Asia, before spreading westward and into Africa. Since 2018, Latin America and the South Pacific received a lot of attention. However, South Asia and Southeast Asia ultimately emerged as the main foci. Earlier this month, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) issued its annual Asia-Pacific Regional Security Assessment. Meia Nouwens, Senior Fellow for Chinese Security and Defense Policy at IISS, contributed a chapter entitled China\'s Belt and Road Initiative a Decade on.\nNouwens discussed the implications for four key regions. Beginning in Southeast Asia, she said this region will remain Beijing\'s chief area of strategic importance. China has been ASEAN\'s largest trading partner since 2009, and the bloc has been China\'s largest trading partner since 2020. Maritime routes run through Southeast Asian chokepoints too, encouraging China to push railways as an alternative. Key recipients have been Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, the Philippines and Vietnam. Naturally, China wants Southeast Asia to be non-aligned, to serve as a bulwark against American influence.\nHowever, China is not doing itself any favours with continual harassment of Philippine and Vietnamese commercial and law enforcement activities in the South China Sea. Western countries are leery of adopting Chinese 5G telecommunication networks, but this is not the case in many developing countries. Nonetheless, as China exerts tighter control over domestic private-sector technology companies, this will complicate their ability to execute projects overseas. The USA\'s stricter regulation of semiconductor and microchip technologies will also complicate China\'s ambitions.\nAccording to Nouwens, fear of economic dependency, ethnic tensions, project build quality and corporate social responsibility remain troubling issues for China. Ethnic tensions often result from beliefs that Chinese-led projects benefit migrant workers rather than the local population. In Indonesia, for instance, Chinese guest workers rose from 17,515 in 2015 to 30,000 in 2018. Considering the South Asia region, unsurprisingly it is Pakistan that has received the lion\'s share of BRI investment, absorbing more than half the money. China\'s heavy investment in road, rail and pipeline infrastructure through the Himalayas as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is not paying economic dividends, however.\nIndeed, it is far more expensive to transport products overland through Pakistan than by traditional sea routes. For instance, if shifting 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day via the Burma-China pipeline, and 250,000 barrels daily through the Pakistan-China pipeline, China would lose approximately USD1 billion per year compared to the traditional seaborne tanker route. Another estimate predicts that shipping oil from the Persian Gulf to China\'s east coast would cost USD2 per barrel, whereas it would cost USD15 per barrel via the Pakistan overland pipeline. Nouwens commented, ""The BRI in South Asia has achieved its intended goal ofexporting Chinese industrial overcapacity abroad. From 2010-18, for example, the value of Chinese industrial goods exports to Pakistan increased from USD3.1 billion to USD8.2 billion. Nevertheless, South Asian BRI projects have faced security, political, economic, geographic and governance challenges.""\nFurthermore, ""Chinese investments in the region have not necessarily created more favourable conditions for Beijing\'s influence. Chinese investment in South Asia has been one factor encouraging India to align more closely with the West, notably through the Quad."" As for Central Asia, boosting ties there is helping China develop its own poorer western provinces. From 2016-21, annual China-Europe freight train journeys snowballed from 1,702 to 15,183.\nNonetheless, most trade between China and Europe still travels by sea (95+ per cent in Germany\'s case), and the Ukraine war has led to a 34 per cent drop in volume via the northern rail corridor. In the South Pacific region, Australia, New Zealand and the USA are very concerned about Chinese interests encroaching, especially since a 2018 uptick. One example is last year\'s Solomon Islands-China security agreement. Nonetheless, this oceanic region attracts only a tiny proportion of BRI funds, with the largest beneficiaries being Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.\nNouwens concluded, ""Despite Chinese loans and grants to the sub-region, China and the BRI have made only a minimal impact in recipient Pacific Island states. There has not been any significant shift in Chinese investment or trade towards the sub-region, with the exception of Papua New Guinea. Exports from China to the South Pacific have increased twelvefold in value between 2000 and 2018, though the numbers for exports from Pacific Island countries to China have grown at a much less impressive rate."" Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu are the most indebted islands to China, with Tonga owing about 25 per cent of its annual GDP to the Export-Import Bank of China. Interestingly, only Solomon Islands and Kiribati signed up for new Chinese loans between 2017 and 2021.\nBy 2021, 64 per cent of BRI projects in Southeast Asia, the South Pacific and South Asiahad been completed, according to Nouwen\'s research. A further 22 per cent of projects were ongoing, and the remaining 14 per cent were still in the planning stage. The BRI, therefore, looks rosy, right? Yet Nouwens pointed out, ""...Judging implementation against these metrics risks overlooking both the fact that the last decade of BRI implementation has in some ways proved to be chaotic, and also the question of recipient countries\' agency. The BRI\'s rollout in the last ten years has lacked central bureaucratic oversight and control or a coherent implementation strategy.""\nThe BRI was initially run under vague action plans, with existing projects simply rebadged as BRI ones. As Nouwens noted, ""The reality of the BRI is that propaganda exceeds implementation, activity overtakes purpose, and actors further down the hierarchy have much latitude in interpreting the terms of their involvement. Instead of being seen as effective tools of statecraft, the BRI and DSR should perhaps be viewed as tools of the CCP\'s \'party craft\'."" For this reason, the BRI has not had the widespread impact that many Western leaders feared during its peak in 2016. ""Importantly, the idea of debt-trap diplomacy turned out to be unproven, and China\'s investment in nearly 60 ports worldwide has not - contrary to the expressed fears of some commentators - provided it with immediate access to a global network of dual-use ports, let alone naval bases,"" the IISS researcher concluded.\nElsewhere, Lee Jones and Shahar Hameiri, in a Chatham House August 2020 research paper entitled ""Debunking the Myth of Debt-Trap Diplomacy"", concluded ""that the BRI is, in fact, motivated largely by economic factors. It has also shown that China\'s fragmented and poorly coordinated international development financing system is not geared towards advancing coherent geopolitical aims ... The BRI does not follow a top-down plan, but emerges piecemeal, through diverse bilateral interactions, with outcomes being shaped by interests, agendas and governance problems on both sides.""

Rather, it could be asked whether, instead of trapping sovereign countries in Chinese debt for strategic value, Beijing has inadvertently been caught in a debt trap of its own making."" Fears of debt-trap diplomacy for client states have not really emerged. Ironically, China might be sufferings most from a debt trap, due to profligate and unregulated investment in the BRI\'s early years, and the economic difficulties being faced by many recipients.\nWith the BRI facing stiffer headwinds, Xi has fine-tuned his prized BRI as he seeks to ram home perceived advantages. These three inchoate efforts are the Global Data Security Initiative (GDSI), Global Development Initiative (GDI) and Global Security Initiative (GSI).

10,38,10_russia_china_united_states,Strategic Competition,"['russia', 'china', 'united', 'states', 'military', 'chinas', 'war', 'chinese', 'defense', 'nato']","[""Like his immediate predecessor, Joe Biden is committed to a distinctly anti-China global strategy and has sworn that China will not 'become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world… on my watch.' In the topsy-turvy universe created by the Covid-19 pandemic, it was, however, Jamie Dimon, the CEO and chairman of JP Morgan Chase, a banking giant with assets of $3.4 trillion, who spoke truth to Biden on the subject.\nWhile predicting an immediate boom in the U.S. economy 'that could easily run into 2023,' Dimon had grimmer news on the future as well. 'China's leaders believe that America is in decline,' he wrote in his annual letter to the company's shareholders. While the U.S. had faced tough times in the past, he added, today 'the Chinese see an America that is losing ground in technology, infrastructure, and education — a nation torn and crippled by politics, as well as racial and income inequality — and a country unable to coordinate government policies (fiscal, monetary, industrial, regulatory) in any coherent way to accomplish national goals.' He was forthright enough to say, 'Unfortunately, recently, there is a lot of truth to this.'\nAs for China, Dimon could also have added, its government possesses at least two powerful levers in areas where the United States is likely to prove vulnerable: dominant control of container ports worldwide and the supplies of rare earth metals critical not just to the information-technology sector but also to the production of electric and hybrid cars, jet fighters, and missile guidance systems. And that's only a partial list of the areas where China is poised to become dominant in the foreseeable future. Here's a likely scenario.\nThe Digital Yuan Versus the (Missing) Digital Dollar\nWithin the broad headline of the globe's 'second-largest economy,' China has already either surpassed the United States or is running neck-and-neck with it in certain specific sectors.\nWith a global smartphone market share of 20% in the second quarter of 2020, China's Huawei Technologies topped the charts, marginally exceeding South Korea's Samsung, and well ahead of Apple, according to the International Data Corporation. This happened despite a concerted drive by President Donald Trump's administration to damage Huawei that culminated, in May 2020, with Washington barring companies worldwide from using U.S.-made machinery or software to design or produce chips for that company or its entities from that September on. Nonetheless, with a 47% share of China's booming 5G smartphone market, Huawei topped the listthere while it kept up its investment in future-oriented, cutting-edge technologies and basic research to the tune of a striking $3 billion to $5 billion annually.\nBroadly speaking, China continues to make impressive strides when it comes to developing its information and communications technology sector. Its Fintech (Financial Technology) report, published in October 2020, showed that an estimated 87% of Chinese consumers used fintech services. With a vast mobile-payment system that hit $29 trillion (200 trillion yuan) worth of payments in 2019, China is shaping up to become the globe's first 'cashless society' and its largest financial-technology ecosystem by the end of this decade.\nLess than 10% of Americans use mobile payments, which means a similar scenario for the United States is nowhere on the horizon. With mobile transactions in China already accounting for at least four out of every five payments and more than half the value of all non-cash retail payments, that country is poised to leave the U.S., a comparative laggard in fintech, shackled to a cash-dominated system.\nIn their relentless drive for innovation, the Chinese authorities started pushing the development of a digital currency in certain regions in August 2020. Their specific goals were to make daily life easier for citizens and digital payments more secure. While non-bank payment platforms like Alipay and WeChat Pay required users to link to bank accounts, a digital wallet with an e-currency deposit could be opened with a unique personal identification — a driver's license or a mobile phone number — enabling the un-banked population of China to embrace the digital world.\nAs a result, the People's Bank of China became the first major central bank to issue a virtual currency. A broader roll-out is expected for the Winter Olympics in Beijing in February 2022, which will give the digital yuan international exposure.\nThis has alarmed the Biden administration. Officials at the Treasury Department, the State Department, the Pentagon, and the National Security Council are frantically trying to comprehend the potential implications of a virtual yuan system. They are particularly eager to understand how it would be distributed, and whether it could be used to bypass Washington's international sanctions as applied to Iran. What distresses some American officials and experts is the notion that someday China's virtual yuan could replace the U.S. dollar as the world's dominant reserve currency.\nAt the Federal Reserve, Chairman Jerome Powell insisted that the central bank was involved in a large-scale research and development project on a possible future digital dollar, though pointing out that such a project could only be launched via a law that would have to be passed by a deeply divided Congress. In short, irrespective of the future of China's virtual currency, a digital dollar is not likely, not in the near future anyway.\nBuilding Infrastructure (or Not)\nAs for recent economic history, even a cursory look at the performances of the United States and China in combating the 2008 financial meltdown tells a striking tale.\nChina made an indelible mark in meeting that financial challenge. Its government sharply increased its infrastructure spending, resulting in higher imports that helped counter flagging global demand. While this move increased Beijing's debt, it also helped build a foundation to further transform the country's economy into a productivity-led growth model. A decade after that great recession, according to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report, China's infrastructure ranking jumped from 66th place to 36th place out of 152 countries.\nAlthough infrastructure building on a large scale requires significant upfront investment, it's guaranteed to yield productivity gains in the long run. Time and cost savings for commuters, improved market access, healthier competition, increased exchange of ideas, and enlarged innovation capacity, all aided by modern infrastructure, are a springboard for economic development.\nDuring the decade following the 2008 crisis, the number of Chinese cities with metro services jumped from 10 to 34 and 1.1 million kilometers of highways were built, raising the total to 4.8 million kilometers. The length of its high-speed rail system shot up by 52,000 kilometers to 132,000 kilometers. Introduced on the eve of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, it's now by far the world's longest system, accounting for two-thirds of the globe's high-speed rail. Its advances in information-and computer-technology were equally impressive. On average, mobile-phone subscriptions came to exceed one per person — about the same as in the United States.\nHigh-speed rail (of which the United States has none) reduces journey times, while linking dense urban areas with less crowded cities. In doing so, it allows for a more balanced distribution of labor and business development without sacrificing the benefits of an increasingly urbanized economy. Economies of scale in turn mean that productivity rises as rail usage increases.\nLittle wonder, then, that President Barack Obama and his team promoted the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 as an infrastructure-building program in response to the 2008 economic crisis. In reality, however, only $80 billion, a tenth of the money Congress sanctioned, would be devoted to actual infrastructure. Of that, about a third was spent on roads and bridges, improving about 67,600 kilometers of roads and 2,700 bridges. The program also included investment in modern infrastructure like smart grids and broadband development.\nIn 2010, Obama announced what was to be the 'largest investment in infrastructure since the Interstate Highway System,' the creation of a high-speed rail network that would rival China's. More than a decade later, the only visible progress is a much-delayed and still incomplete 275-kilometer Central Valley California line from Bakersfield to Merced. And in the Trump years, when essentially no government money went into such projects, 'infrastructure week' became a standing joke. President Biden seems determined to rectify this, but how successful he'll be with his $2 trillioninfrastructure proposal in the face of a rigidly divided Congress remains to be seen.\nFor its part, the Chinese government combined its program of rapid infrastructure development with upgrading of the labor force. It did so by implementing an educational system that stressed science, technology, engineering, and math, known as STEM. By achieving higher productivity in this way, the government planned to compensate for a projected shrinkage in its work force.\nTo promote STEM, the government issued guidelines in 2016 to create a national development strategy aimed at advancing China to the forefront of innovative countries by 2030. In February 2017, the Ministry of Education officially added STEM education to the primary-school curriculum. Since then, encouraged by official policies, schools in both the public and private sectors have implemented such programs.\nIn 2019, the government allocated 100% of its research funding to top universities to the ones that concentrated on STEM disciplines. By comparison, South Korea allocated 62% of such funding that way. By contrast, U.S. universities ranked in the top 100 maintained a greater balance in funding among STEM fields, humanities, and social sciences.\nIn October 2019, three of China's biggest mobile-phone carriers launched advanced 5G services, giving it the world's largest 5G mobile network. A year later, the Wall Street Journal reported that China had more 5G subscribers than the U.S., not just in total but per capita.\nGiven the ubiquity of smartphones, the news that America seemed to be losing the tech race to China was widely noted. Mostly ignored, however, was the extent to which the U.S. had become vulnerable to Chinese pressure in international trade.\nAmerica's Vulnerabilities\nIn testimony before Congress in October 2019, Carolyn Bartholomew, chairwoman of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, revealed that at least two-thirds of the world's top 50 maritime container ports were directly owned and managed by the Chinese or supported by that country's investments (up from roughly 20% a decade ago). These included terminals at major American container ports in Los Angeles and Seattle. When it came to such ports, it led the world with seven of the 10 largest ones.\nA year earlier, officials at the state-owned China Ocean Shipping Company, one of the globe's largest container shipping lines, acknowledged that the company had connected its routes along what was officially called the Maritime Silk Road, linking regional markets in West Africa, Northern Europe, the Caribbean, and the U.S. to form a more comprehensive and balanced globalized trading network. 'By owning and/or operating a network of logistical nodes across Asia, Europe, and Africa, China can control a significant portion of its inbound supply chain for essential commodities and outbound trade routes for its exports,' Bartholomew explained. 'In the event of conflict, China could use its control over these and other ports to hinder trade access to other countries.'\nIn the manufacturing sector, China finds itself in a privileged position by virtue of its special mineral deposits, called rare earth elements. A group of 17 rare earth metals, including lanthanum, cerium, yttrium, europium, and gadolinium, often called 'industrial gold,' are critical components of such high-technology and clean-energy products as wind turbines, solar panels, and electric cars, because of their magnetism, luminescence, and strength. They are also used in a wide variety of weapons from jet fighters to nuclear submarines.\nUnsurprisingly, in recent years, there has been a rapid rise in the demand for these minerals in advanced economies. They are dispersed in low concentrations and are costly to extract from ore, an industry in which China has invested a great deal since the 1970s.\nAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey, in 2020, China accounted for 58% of rare earth minerals production, down from around 90% four years earlier, as the United States and Australia boosted their own mining of them. Still, as of 2018, the United States imported 80.5% of its rare earth metals from China. In May of that year, the Trump administration added these to a list of minerals deemed critical to American economic and national security. And in July 2019, it declared them 'essential to the national defense,' which freed up resources for the Department of Defense to take action to secure a domestic rare earth production capability.\nEven if the mining of these ores increased in the U.S., refining them requires specialist technology and trained personnel as well as high upfront investment. Due to the lack of these in the U.S. so far, China continues to enjoy a near monopoly in processing the ore, with the raw material containing the prized metal mined outside China shipped to the Chinese sites. The refining process also generates large amounts of radioactive waste and pollutes the environment. As a result, developed countries usually opt for getting the refining done in emerging economies.\nAll in all, when you view the globe in the throes of a once-in-a-century pandemic, you find an authoritarian state, wedded to centralized planning, initiating programs with long-term benefits for its citizens and seeing them through. You also see a politically riven democratic republic operating primarily on an ad hoc basis.\nThe stark truth is that an American president cannot even bet on his policies, however laudable or otherwise, surviving his four-year term. Trump's succession after the Obama era illustrated this dramatically, as has that of Trump's successor, Biden. When judged purely on the basis of final results, centralized planning clearly beats short-term programming, even if it is viewed with a mixture of derision and condemnation by the Western governments that Biden is attempting to coopt to challenge China. The reality of our moment: that country is now rising on a distinctly wounded planet.\nThis column was distributed by TomDispatch."", 'Like his immediate predecessor, Joe Biden is committed to a distinctly anti-China global strategy and has sworn that China will not ""become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world… on my watch."" In the topsy-turvy universe created by the Covid-19 pandemic, it was, however, Jamie Dimon, the CEO and chairman of JP Morgan Chase, a banking giant with assets of $3.4 trillion, who spoke truth to Biden on the subject.While predicting an immediate boom in the U.S. economy ""that could easily run into 2023,"" Dimon had grimmer news on the future as well. ""China\'s leaders believe that America is in decline,"" he wrote in his annual letter to the company\'s shareholders. While the U.S. had faced tough times in the past, he added, today ""the Chinese see an America that is losing ground in technology, infrastructure, and education — a nation torn and crippled by politics, as well as racial and income inequality — and a country unable to coordinate government policies (fiscal, monetary, industrial, regulatory) in any coherent way to accomplish national goals."" He was forthright enough to say, ""Unfortunately, recently, there is a lot of truth to this.""As for China, Dimon could also have added, its government possesses at least two powerful levers in areas where the United States is likely to prove vulnerable: dominant control of container ports worldwide and the supplies of rare earth metals critical not just to the information-technology sector but also to the production of electric and hybrid cars, jet fighters, and missile guidance systems. And that\'s only a partial list of the areas where China is poised to become dominant in the foreseeable future. Here\'s a likely scenario.The Digital Yuan Versus the (Missing) Digital DollarWithin the broad headline of the globe\'s ""second-largest economy,"" China has already either surpassed the United States or is running neck-and-neck with it in certain specific sectors.With a global smartphone market share of 20% in the second quarter of 2020, China\'s Huawei Technologies topped the charts, marginally exceeding South Korea\'s Samsung, and well ahead of Apple, according to the International Data Corporation. This happened despite a concerted drive by President Donald Trump\'s administration to damage Huawei that culminated, in May 2020, with Washington barring companies worldwide from using U.S.-made machinery or software to design or produce chips for that company or its entities from that September on. Nonetheless, with a 47% share of China\'s booming 5G smartphone market, Huawei topped the list there while it kept up its investment in future-oriented, cutting-edge technologies and basic research to the tune of a striking $3 billion to $5 billion annually.Broadly speaking, China continues to make impressive strides when it comes to developing its information and communications technology sector. Its Fintech (Financial Technology) report, published in October 2020, showed that an estimated 87% of Chinese consumers used fintech services. With a vast mobile-payment system that hit $29 trillion (200 trillion yuan) worth of payments in 2019, China is shaping up to become the globe\'s first ""cashless society"" and its largest financial-technology ecosystem by the end of this decade.Less than 10% of Americans use mobile payments, which means a similar scenario for the United States is nowhere on the horizon.

A year later, The Wall Street Journal reported that China had more 5G subscribers than the United States, not just in total but per capita.Given the ubiquity of smartphones, the news that America seemed to be losing the tech race to China was widely noted. Mostly ignored, however, was the extent to which the United States had become vulnerable to Chinese pressure in international trade.America's VulnerabilitiesIn testimony before Congress in October 2019, Carolyn Bartholomew, chairwoman of the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, revealed that at least two-thirds of the world's top 50 maritime container ports were directly owned and managed by the Chinese or supported by that country's investments (up from roughly 20 percent a decade ago). These included terminals at major American container ports in Los Angeles and Seattle. When it came to such ports, it led the world with seven of the 10 largest ones.A year earlier, officials at the state-owned China Ocean Shipping Company, one of the globe's largest container shipping lines, acknowledged that the company had connected its routes along what was officially called the Maritime Silk Road, linking regional markets in West Africa, Northern Europe, the Caribbean, and the United States to form a more comprehensive and balanced globalized trading network. 'By owning and/or operating a network of logistical nodes across Asia, Europe, and Africa, China can control a significant portion of its inbound supply chain for essential commodities and outbound trade routes for its exports,' Bartholomew explained. 'In the event of conflict, China could use its control over these and other ports to hinder trade access to other countries.'In the manufacturing sector, China finds itself in a privileged position by virtue of its special mineral deposits, called rare earth elements. A group of 17 rare earth metals, including lanthanum, cerium, yttrium, europium, and gadolinium, often called 'industrial gold,' are critical components of such high-technology and clean-energy products as wind turbines, solar panels, and electric cars, because of their magnetism, luminescence, and strength. They are also used in a wide variety of weapons from jet fighters to nuclear submarines.Unsurprisingly, in recent years, there has been a rapid rise in the demand for these minerals in advanced economies. They are dispersed in low concentrations and are costly to extract from ore, an industry in which China has invested a great deal since the 1970s.According to the US Geological Survey, in 2020, China accounted for 58 percent of rare earth minerals production, down from around 90 percent four years earlier, as the United States and Australia boosted their own mining of them. Still, as of 2018, the United States imported 80.5 percent of its rare earth metals from China. In May of that year, the Trump administration added these to a list of minerals deemed critical to American economic and national security. And in July 2019, it declared them 'essential to the national defense,' which freed up resources for the Department of Defense to take action to secure a domestic rare earth production capability.Even if the mining of these ores increased in the United States, refining them requires specialist technology and trained personnel as well as high upfront investment. Due to the lack of these in the United States so far, China continues to enjoy a near monopoly in processing the ore, with the raw material containing the prized metal mined outside China shipped to the Chinese sites. The refining process also generates large amounts of radioactive waste and pollutes the environment. As a result, developed countries usually opt for getting the refining done in emerging economies.All in all, when you view the globe in the throes of a once-in-a-century pandemic, you find an authoritarian state, wedded to centralized planning, initiating programs with long-term benefits for its citizens and seeing them through. You also see a politically riven democratic republic operating primarily on an ad hoc basis.The stark truth is that an American president cannot even bet on his policies, however laudable or otherwise, surviving his four-year term. Trump's succession after the Obama era illustrated this dramatically, as has that of Trump's successor, Biden. When judged purely on the basis of final results, centralized planning clearly beats short-term programming, even if it is viewed with a mixture of derision and condemnation by the Western governments that Biden is attempting to co-opt to challenge China. The reality of our moment: That country is now rising on a distinctly wounded planet.""]"

Lenin. Mao. Deng. Xi. Late last week in Beijing, the sixth plenum of the Chinese Communist Party adopted a\xa0historic resolution\xa0– only the third in its 100-year history – detailing major accomplishments and laying out a vision for the future. Essentially, the resolution poses three questions. How did we get here? How come we were so successful? And what have we learned to make these successes long-lasting? Chinese President Xi Jinping is poised to take a third five-year term. Image: Agencies / Pool The importance of this resolution should not be underestimated. It imprints a major geopolitical fact: China is back. Big time. And doing it their way. No amount of fear and loathing deployed by the declining hegemon will alter this path. The resolution will inevitably prompt quite a few misunderstandings. So allow me a little deconstruction, from the point of view of a\xa0gwailo\xa0who has lived between East and West for the past 27 years. If we compare China's 31 provinces with the 214 sovereign states that compose the 'international community', every Chinese region has experienced the fastest economic growth rates in the world. Across the West, the lineaments of China's notorious growth equation – without any historical parallel – have usually assumed the mantle of an unsolvable mystery. Little Helmsman Deng Xiaoping's 's famous 'crossing the river while feeling the stones', described as the path to build 'socialism with Chinese characteristics' may be the overarching vision. But the devil has always been in the details: how the Chinese applied – with a mix of prudence and audaciousness – every possible device to facilitate the transition towards a modern economy. The – hybrid – result has been defined by a delightful oxymoron: 'communist market economy.' Actually, that's the perfect practical translation of Deng's legendary 'it doesn't matter the color of the cat, as long as it catches mice.' And it was this oxymoron, in fact, that the new resolution passed in Beijing celebrated last week. Made in China 2025 Mao and Deng have been exhaustively analyzed over the years. Let's focus here on Papa Xi's brand new bag. Right after he was elevated to the apex of the party, Xi defined his unambiguous master plan: to accomplish the 'Chinese dream', or China's 'renaissance.' In this case, in political economy terms, 'renaissance' meant to realign China to its rightful place in a history spanning at least three millennia: right at the center. Middle Kingdom, indeed. Already during his first term Xi managed to imprint a new ideological framework. The Party – as in centralized power – should lead the economy towards what was rebranded as 'the new era.'\xa0A reductionist formulation would be\xa0The State Strikes Back. In fact, it was way more complicated. This was not merely a rehash of state-run economy standards. Nothing to do with a Maoist structure capturing large swathes of the economy. Xi embarked in what we could sum up as a quite original form of authoritarian state capitalism – where the state is simultaneously an actor and the arbiter of economic life. Team Xi did learn a lot of lessons from the West, using mechanisms of regulation and supervision to check, for instance, the shadow banking sphere. Macroeconomically, the expansion of public debt in China was contained, and the extension of credit better supervised. It took only a few years for Beijing to be convinced that major financial sphere risks were under control. China's new economic groove was de facto announced in 2015 via 'Made in China 2025', reflecting the centralized ambition of reinforcing the civilization-state's economic and technological independence. That would imply a serious reform of somewhat inefficient public companies – as some had become states within the state. In tandem, there was a redesign of the 'decisive role of the market' – with the emphasis that new riches would have to be at the disposal of China's renaissance as its strategic interests – defined, of course, by the party. So the new arrangement amounted to imprinting a 'culture of results' into the public sector while associating the private sector to the pursuit of an overarching national ambition. How to pull it off? By facilitating the party's role as general director and encouraging public-private partnerships. The Chinese state disposes of immense means and resources that fit its ambition. Beijing made sure that these resources would be available for those companies that perfectly understood they were on a mission: to contribute to the advent of a 'new era.' Manual for power projection There's no question that China under Xi, in eight short years, was deeply transformed. Whatever the liberal West makes of it – hysteria about neo-Maoism included – from a Chinese point of view that's absolutely irrelevant, and won't derail the process. What must be understood, by both the Global North and South, is the conceptual framework of the 'Chinese dream': Xi's unshakeable ambition is that the renaissance of China will finally smash the memories of the 'century of humiliation' for good. Party discipline – the Chinese way – is really something to behold. The CCP is the only communist party on the planet that thanks to Deng has discovered the secret of amassing wealth. And that brings us to Xi's role enshrined as a great transformer, on the same conceptual level as Mao and Deng. He fully grasped how the state and the party created wealth: the next step is to use the party and wealth as instruments to be put at the service of China's renaissance. Nothing, not even a nuclear war, will deviate Xi and the Beijing leadership from this path. They even devised a mechanism – and a slogan – for the new power projection: the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), originally One Belt, One Road (OBOR). A mountain pass along the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Image: Facebook In 2017, BRI was incorporated into the party statutes. Even considering the 'lost in translation' angle, there's no Westernized, linear definition for BRI. BRI is deployed on many superimposed levels. It started with a series of investments facilitating the supply of commodities to China. Then came investments in transport and connectivity infrastructure, with all their nodes and hubs such as Khorgos, at the Chinese-Kazakh border. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), announced in 2013, symbolized the symbiosis of these two investment paths. The next step was to transform logistical hubs into integrated economic zones – for instance as in HP based in Chongjing exporting its products via a BRI rail network to the Netherlands. Then came the Digital Silk Roads – from 5G to AI – and the Covid-linked Health Silk Roads. What's certain is that all these roads lead to Beijing. They work as much as economic corridors as soft power avenues, 'selling' the Chinese way especially across the Global South. Make Trade, Not War Make Trade, Not War: that would be the motto of a Pax Sinica under Xi. The crucial aspect is that Beijing does not aim to replace Pax Americana, which always relied on the Pentagon's variant of gunboat diplomacy. The declaration subtly reinforced that Beijing is not interested in becoming a new hegemon. What matters above all is to remove any possible constraints that the outside world may impose over its own internal decisions, and especially over its unique political setup. The West may embark on hysteria fits over anything – from Tibet and Hong Kong to Xinjiang and Taiwan. It won't change a thing. Concisely, this is how 'socialism with Chinese characteristics' – a unique, always mutant economic system – arrived at the Covid-linked techno-feudalist era. But no one knows how long the system will last, and in which mutant form. Corruption, debt – which tripled in ten years – political infighting – none of that has disappeared in China. To reach 5% annual growth, China would have to recover the growth in productivity comparable to those breakneck times in the 80s and 90s, but that will not happen because a decrease in growth is accompanied by a parallel decrease in productivity.

December 16 2022 \nPhoto Credit: The Cradle \n By\xa0Pepe\xa0Escobar It would be so tempting to qualify Chinese President Xi Jinping landing in Riyadh a week ago, welcomed with royal pomp and circumstance, as Xi of Arabia proclaiming the dawn of the petroyuan era. But it's more complicated than that. As much as the seismic shift implied by the petroyuan move applies, Chinese diplomacy is way too sophisticated to engage in direct confrontation, especially with a wounded, ferocious Empire. So there's way more going here than meets the (Eurasian) eye. Xi of Arabia's announcement was a prodigy of finesse: it was packaged as the internationalization of the yuan. From now on, Xi said, China will use the yuan for oil trade, through the Shanghai Petroleum and National Gas Exchange, and invited the Persian Gulf monarchies to get on board. Nearly 80 percent of trade in the global oil market continues to be priced in US dollars. Ostensibly, Xi of Arabia, and his large Chinese delegation of officials and business leaders, met with the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to promote increased trade. Beijing promised to 'import crude oil in a consistent manner and in large quantities from the GCC.' And the same goes for natural gas. China has been the largest importer of crude on the planet for five years now – half of it from the Arabian peninsula, and more than a quarter from Saudi Arabia. So it's no wonder that the prelude for Xi of Arabia's lavish welcome in Riyadh was a\xa0special op-ed\xa0expanding the trading scope, and praising increased strategic/commercial partnerships across the GCC, complete with '5G communications, new energy, space and digital economy.' Foreign Minister Wang Yi\xa0doubled down\xa0on the 'strategic choice' of China and wider Arabia. Over $30 billion in trade deals were duly signed – quite a few significantly connected to China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects. And that brings us to the two key connections established by Xi of Arabia: the BRI and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). The Silk Roads of Arabia BRI will get a serious boost by Beijing in 2023, with the return of the Belt and Road Forum. The first two bi-annual forums took place in 2017 and 2019. Nothing happened in 2021 because of China's strict zero-Covid policy, now abandoned for all practical purposes. The year 2023 is pregnant with meaning as BRI was first launched 10 years ago by Xi, first in Central Asia (Astana) and then Southeast Asia (Jakarta). BRI not only embodies a complex, multi-track trans-Eurasian trade/connectivity drive but it is the overarching Chinese foreign policy concept at least until the mid-21st\xa0century. So the 2023 forum is expected to bring to the forefront a series of new and redesigned projects adapted to a post-Covid and debt-distressed world, and most of all to the loaded Atlanticism vs. Eurasianism geopolitical and geoeconomic sphere. Also significantly, Xi of Arabia in December followed Xi of Samarkand in September – his first post-Covid overseas trip, for the SCO summit in which Iran officially joined as a full member. China and Iran in 2021 clinched a 25-year strategic partnership deal worth a potential $400 billion in investments. That's the other node of China's two-pronged West Asia strategy. The nine permanent SCO members now represent 40 percent of the world's population. One of their key decisions in Samarkand was to increase bilateral trade, and overall trade, in\xa0their own currencies. And that further connects us to what has happening in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, in full synchronicity with Riyadh: the meeting of the Supreme Eurasia Economic Council, the policy implementation arm of the Eurasia Economic Union (EAEU). Russian President Vladimir Putin, in Kyrgyzstan, could not have been\xa0more straightforward: 'The work has accelerated in\xa0the\xa0transition to\xa0national currencies in\xa0mutual settlements… The\xa0process of\xa0creating a\xa0common payment infrastructure and\xa0integrating national systems for\xa0the\xa0transmission of\xa0financial information has begun.' The next Supreme Eurasian Economic Council will take place in Russia in May 2023, ahead of the Belt and Road Forum. Take them together and we have the lineaments of the geoeconomic road map ahead: the drive towards the petroyuan proceeding in parallel to the drive towards a 'common paying infrastructure' and most of all, a new alternative currency bypassing the US dollar. That's exactly what the head of the EAEU's macroeconomic policy,\xa0Sergey Glazyev, has been designing, side by side with Chinese specialists. Total Financial War The move towards the petroyuan will be fraught with immense peril. In every serious geoeconomic gaming scenario, it's a given that an enfeebled petrodollar translates as the end of the imperial free lunch in effect for over five decades. Concisely, in 1971, then-US President Richard 'Tricky Dick' Nixon pulled the US from the gold standard; three years later, after the 1973 oil shock, Washington approached the Saudi oil minister, notorious Sheikh Yamani, with the proverbial offer-you-can't-refuse: we buy your oil in US dollars and in return you buy our Treasury bonds, lots of weapons, and recycle whatever's left in our banks. Cue to Washington now suddenly able to dispense helicopter money – backed by nothing – ad infinitum, and the US dollar as the ultimate hegemonic weapon, complete with an array of sanctions over 30 nations who dare to disobey the unilaterally imposed 'rules-based international order.' Impulsively rocking this imperial boat is anathema. So Beijing and the GCC will adopt the petroyuan slowly but surely, and certainly with zero fanfare. The heart of the matter, once again, is their mutual exposure to the Western financial casino. In the Chinese case, what to do, for instance, with those whopping $1 trillion in US Treasury bonds. In the Saudi case, it's hard to think about 'strategic autonomy' – such as what's enjoyed by Iran – when the petrodollar is a staple of the Western financial system. The menu of possible imperial reactions includes everything from a soft coup/ regime change to Shock and Awe over Riyadh – followed by regime change. Yet what the Chinese – and the Russians – are aiming at goes way beyond a Saudi (and Emirati) predicament. Beijing and Moscow have clearly identified how everything – the oil market, global commodities markets – is tied to the role of the US dollar as reserve currency. And that's exactly what the EAEU discussions; the SCO discussions; from now on the BRICS+ discussions; and Beijing's two-pronged strategy across West Asia are focused to undermine. Beijing and Moscow, within the BRICS framework, and further on within the SCO and the EAEU, have been closely coordinating their strategy since the first sanctions on Russia post-Maidan 2014, and the de facto trade war against China unleashed in 2018. Now, after the February 2022 Special Military Operation launched by Moscow in Ukraine and NATO has devolved into, for all practical purposes, war against Russia, we have stepped beyond Hybrid War territory and are deep into Total Financial War. SWIFTly drifting away The whole Global South absorbed the 'lesson' of the collective (institutional) west freezing, as in stealing, the foreign reserves of a G20 member, on top of it a nuclear superpower. If that happened to Russia, it could happen to anyone. There are no 'rules' anymore. Russia since 2014 has been improving its SPFS payment system, in parallel with China's CIPS, both bypassing the western-led SWIFT banking messaging system, and increasingly used by Central Banks across Central Asia, Iran and India. All across Eurasia, more people are ditching Visa and Mastercard and using UnionPay and/or Mir cards, not to mention Alipay and WeChat Pay, both extremely popular across Southeast Asia. Of course the petrodollar – and the US dollar, still representing under 60 percent of global foreign exchange reserves – will not ride into oblivion overnight. Xi of Arabia is just the latest chapter in a seismic shift now driven by a select group in the Global South, and not by the former 'hyperpower.' Trading in their own currencies and a new, global alternative currency is right at the top of the priorities of that long list of nations – from South America to Northern Africa and West Asia – eager to join BRICS+ or the SCO, and in quite a few cases, both. The stakes could not be higher. And it's all about subjugation or exercising full sovereignty. So let's leave the last essential words to the foremost diplomat of our troubled times, Russia's Sergey Lavrov, at the international interparty conference\xa0Eurasian Choice as a Basis for Strengthening Sovereignty: 'The main reason for today's growing tensions is the stubborn striving of the collective West to maintain a historically diminishing domination in the international arena by any means it can… It is impossible to impede the strengthening of the independent centers of economic growth, financial might and political influence. They are emerging on our common continent of Eurasia, in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa.' All aboard…the Sovereign Train.

Beijing and Moscow have clearly identified how everything – the oil market, global commodities markets – is tied to the role of the US dollar as reserve currency.And that's exactly what the EAEU discussions; the SCO discussions; from now on the BRICS+ discussions; and Beijing's two-pronged strategy across West Asia are focused to undermine.Beijing and Moscow, within the BRICS framework, and further on within the SCO and the EAEU, have been closely coordinating their strategy since the first sanctions on Russia post-Maidan 2014, and the de facto trade war against China unleashed in 2018.Now, after the February 2022 Special Military Operation launched by Moscow in Ukraine and NATO has devolved into, for all practical purposes, war against Russia, we have stepped beyond Hybrid War territory and are deep into Total Financial War.SWIFTly drifting awayThe whole Global South absorbed the 'lesson' of the collective (institutional) west freezing, as in stealing, the foreign reserves of a G20 member, on top of it a nuclear superpower. If that happened to Russia, it could happen to anyone.

Xi of Arabia is just the latest chapter in a seismic shift now driven by a select group in the Global South, and not by the former 'hyperpower.'Trading in their own currencies and a new, global alternative currency is right at the top of the priorities of that long list of nations – from South America to Northern Africa and West Asia – eager to join BRICS+ or the SCO, and in quite a few cases, both.The stakes could not be higher. And it's all about subjugation or exercising full sovereignty. So let's leave the last essential words to the foremost diplomat of our troubled times, Russia's Sergey Lavrov, at the international interparty conference\xa0Eurasian Choice as a Basis for Strengthening Sovereignty:'The main reason for today's growing tensions is the stubborn striving of the collective West to maintain a historically diminishing domination in the international arena by any means it can… It is impossible to impede the strengthening of the independent centers of economic growth, financial might and political influence. They are emerging on our common continent of Eurasia, in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa.'All aboard…the Sovereign Train."", ""It would be so tempting to qualify Chinese President Xi Jinping landing in Riyadh a week ago, welcomed with royal pomp and circumstance, as Xi of Arabia proclaiming the dawn of the petroyuan era.\nBut it's more complicated than that. As much as the seismic shift implied by the petroyuan move applies, Chinese diplomacy is way too sophisticated to engage in direct confrontation, especially with a wounded, ferocious Empire. So there's way more going here than meets the (Eurasian) eye.\nXi of Arabia's announcement was a prodigy of finesse: it was packaged as the internationalization of the yuan. From now on, Xi said, China will use the yuan for oil trade, through the Shanghai Petroleum and National Gas Exchange, and invited the Persian Gulf monarchies to get on board. Nearly 80 percent of trade in the global oil market continues to be priced in US dollars.\nOstensibly, Xi of Arabia, and his large Chinese delegation of officials and business leaders, met with the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to promote increased trade. Beijing promised to 'import crude oil in a consistent manner and in large quantities from the GCC.' And the same goes for natural gas.\nChina has been the largest importer of crude on the planet for five years now – half of it from the Arabian peninsula, and more than a quarter from Saudi Arabia. So it's no wonder that the prelude for Xi of Arabia's lavish welcome in Riyadh was a\xa0special op-ed\xa0expanding the trading scope, and praising increased strategic/commercial partnerships across the GCC, complete with '5G communications, new energy, space and digital economy.'\nForeign Minister Wang Yi\xa0doubled down\xa0on the 'strategic choice' of China and wider Arabia. Over $30 billion in trade deals were duly signed – quite a few significantly connected to China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects.\nAnd that brings us to the two key connections established by Xi of Arabia: the BRI and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).\nThe Silk Roads of Arabia\nBRI will get a serious boost by Beijing in 2023, with the return of the Belt and Road Forum. The first two bi-annual forums took place in 2017 and 2019. Nothing happened in 2021 because of China's strict zero-Covid policy, now abandoned for all practical purposes.\nThe year 2023 is pregnant with meaning as BRI was first launched 10 years ago by Xi, first in Central Asia (Astana) and then Southeast Asia (Jakarta).\nBRI not only embodies a complex, multi-track trans-Eurasian trade/connectivity drive but it is the overarching Chinese foreign policy concept at least until the mid-21st\xa0century. So the 2023 forum is expected to bring to the forefront a series of new and redesigned projects adapted to a post-Covid and debt-distressed world, and most of all to the loaded Atlanticism vs. Eurasianism geopolitical and geoeconomic sphere.\nAlso significantly, Xi of Arabia in December followed Xi of Samarkand in September – his first post-Covid overseas trip, for the SCO summit in which Iran officially joined as a full member. China and Iran in 2021 clinched a 25-year strategic partnership deal worth a potential $400 billion in investments. That's the other node of China's two-pronged West Asia strategy.\nThe nine permanent SCO members now represent 40 percent of the world's population. One of their key decisions in Samarkand was to increase bilateral trade, and overall trade, in\xa0their own currencies.\nAnd that further connects us to what has happening in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, in full synchronicity with Riyadh: the meeting of the Supreme Eurasia Economic Council, the policy implementation arm of the Eurasia Economic Union (EAEU).\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, in Kyrgyzstan, could not have been\xa0more straightforward: 'The work has accelerated in\xa0the\xa0transition to\xa0national currencies in\xa0mutual settlements… The\xa0process of\xa0creating a\xa0common payment infrastructure and\xa0integrating national systems for\xa0the\xa0transmission of\xa0financial information has begun.'\nThe next Supreme Eurasian Economic Council will take place in Russia in May 2023, ahead of the Belt and Road Forum. Take them together and we have the lineaments of the geoeconomic road map ahead: the drive towards the petroyuan proceeding in parallel to the drive towards a 'common paying infrastructure' and most of all, a new alternative currency bypassing the US dollar.\nThat's exactly what the head of the EAEU's macroeconomic policy,\xa0Sergey Glazyev, has been designing, side by side with Chinese specialists.\nTotal Financial War\nThe move towards the petroyuan will be fraught with immense peril.\nIn every serious geoeconomic gaming scenario, it's a given that an enfeebled petrodollar translates as the end of the imperial free lunch in effect for over five decades.\nConcisely, in 1971, then-US President Richard 'Tricky Dick' Nixon pulled the US from the gold standard; three years later, after the 1973 oil shock, Washington approached the Saudi oil minister, notorious Sheikh Yamani, with the proverbial offer-you-can't-refuse: we buy your oil in US dollars and in return you buy our Treasury bonds, lots of weapons, and recycle whatever's left in our banks.\nCue to Washington now suddenly able to dispense helicopter money – backed by nothing – ad infinitum, and the US dollar as the ultimate hegemonic weapon, complete with an array of sanctions over 30 nations who dare to disobey the unilaterally imposed 'rules-based international order.'\nImpulsively rocking this imperial boat is anathema. So Beijing and the GCC will adopt the petroyuan slowly but surely, and certainly with zero fanfare. The heart of the matter, once again, is their mutual exposure to the Western financial casino.\nIn the Chinese case, what to do, for instance, with those whopping $1 trillion in US Treasury bonds. In the Saudi case, it's hard to think about 'strategic autonomy' – such as what's enjoyed by Iran – when the petrodollar is a staple of the Western financial system. The menu of possible imperial reactions includes everything from a soft coup/ regime change to Shock and Awe over Riyadh – followed by regime change.\nYet what the Chinese – and the Russians – are aiming at goes way beyond a Saudi (and Emirati) predicament. Beijing and Moscow have clearly identified how everything – the oil market, global commodities markets – is tied to the role of the US dollar as reserve currency.\nAnd that's exactly what the EAEU discussions; the SCO discussions; from now on the BRICS+ discussions; and Beijing's two-pronged strategy across West Asia are focused to undermine.\nBeijing and Moscow, within the BRICS framework, and further on within the SCO and the EAEU, have been closely coordinating their strategy since the first sanctions on Russia post-Maidan 2014, and the de facto trade war against China unleashed in 2018.\nNow, after the February 2022 Special Military Operation launched by Moscow in Ukraine and NATO has devolved into, for all practical purposes, war against Russia, we have stepped beyond Hybrid War territory and are deep into Total Financial War.\nSWIFTly drifting away\nThe whole Global South absorbed the 'lesson' of the collective (institutional) west freezing, as in stealing, the foreign reserves of a G20 member, on top of it a nuclear superpower.
