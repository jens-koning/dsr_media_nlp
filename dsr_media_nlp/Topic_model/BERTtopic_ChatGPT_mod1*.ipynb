China courted North Africa Middle East part technology push; reportedly signed Digital Silk Road memoranda understanding Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates. Cooperation moved quickly Egypt. 2019, Egyptian officials visiting China met leaders ten major Chinese firms discuss increasing investment areas including artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, telecommunications infrastructure.

Huawei reportedly provided technology help Zambian government spy political opponents — situation reportedly repeated Uganda, Huawei helped government monitor political rivals. concerns China's influence Zambia likely suppressed; government President Edgar Lungu also worked censor discourage criticism China Zambian media outlets.Some democracies also worry DSR projects could help Chinese government gain access sensitive data. U.S. officials pressured central east European states use Chinese companies build telecommunications infrastructure, Serbia tried balance U.S. China. Although European countries agreed upon plan limit Huawei's penetration, Serbia welcomed Huawei's assistance upgrading digital infrastructure.Both U.S. government European states worry Chinese government could obtain backdoor access data Huawei networks Serbia. secret backdoor Chinese intelligence, possibly Chinese military, would especially concerning European states; Serbia close links EU.

Particularly, apply existing tech giants digital infrastructure providers would wish sustain lead. Broadly, however, challenges apply stakeholders favor vision open, transparent, free, equitable global cyber domain – digital governance large.In regard, DSR four significant far-reaching strategic implications. First, China build offer digital backbones almost entirely homegrown. backbones infrastructure makes digital communication possible, data cables, cellular networks, data storage centers. Drawing analogy Legos, backbone China builds, build connect foundation – thus strengthening position global digital order.Second, DSR may facilitate China set standards digital infrastructure next-generation tech artificial intelligence, robotics, Internet Things, blockchain, serverless computing, on. Although tech leaders seek set standards, existing tech leaders bound view emerging Chinese attempts set standards competition. Beyond considerations existing tech leaders within wider global considerations, setting standards brings considerable strategic advantages it. Moreover, DSR creates digital arteries likely boost Chinese supply chains, economy, and, therefore, overall global economic influence.Third, China's view digital governance much state-paternalistic nature. differs starkly average liberal Western view digital values norms, especially United States. Chinese government enforces strict restrictions cyberspace China. also hesitate closely monitor netizens considerably sealed domestic 'intranet.' Granted, China certainly country practice restrictive view digital governance, different countries enforce different types levels restrictions cyberspace.

DSR, China expand foreign markets, secure access foreign suppliers consumers, establish technological standards information communications technology. successful, DSR provide demand steady economic innovation China needs. Yet DSR promise innovation contingent China's success hardware. Although country facing competition abroad, formidable obstacles Chinese economic innovation domestic. China became leader 5G technology, level innovation lags different sector. China's primary innovation challenge lack indigenous capabilities high-value digital hardware, particularly semiconductor logic chips. 2010-2020, China attempted consolidate semiconductor industry, encourage domestic semiconductor companies share research development, foreigners reduce export controls, gain human capital high skills foreign countries. early 2022, however, China still design fabricate substantial number highest-value semiconductor logic chips (Chinese market share less 1 percent Chinese share global market less 6 percent). part problem. two highest value semiconductor logic chips central processing units (CPU) graphics processing units (GPU). George Calhoun noted, categories, Chinese-produced chips lower-quality uncompetitive, even China. China chronically behind semiconductor logic design, fabs, foundries? country simply require time, different set strategies needed? answer questions, assessment China's primary challenges semiconductor design production needed. immediate issues China faces semiconductor industry competitiveness quality. Although China required technical capabilities, enough them. Consider Zhaoxin, Chinese semiconductor company. Chinese company produce x86 CPUs (arguably top-performing CPU), supplies semiconductor design electronics companies Lenovo Hewlett-Packard. Huawei Tsinghua Unigroup subsidiary producing semiconductor logic chips, license core intellectual property British company. 'Despite one world's top five semiconductor foundries world,' wrote Zen Soo Meng Jing, China's 'SMIC [Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation] began produce 14nm semiconductors year. makes three generations – least six years – behind rivals.' Generally speaking, China designs memory chips, easier produce logic chips, leader semiconductor assembly packaging. Thus, China making progress design semiconductor logic chips, still largely produces lower-quality semiconductors. government's 'Made China 2025' strategy intends supply 70 percent China's semiconductor demand indigenous design production, unclear goal achieved plan's deadline. current state, Chinese semiconductor companies cannot meet Chinese demand semiconductors, much less global demand. means Chinese manufacturers remain heavily reliant high-quality semiconductors produced overseas. According January 2021 report Georgetown University's Center Security Emerging Technology semiconductor supply chain, U.S. semiconductor industry contributes 39 percent total value global semiconductor supply chain. U.S.-allied nations regions—Japan, Europe (especially Netherlands, United Kingdom, Germany), Taiwan, South Korea—collectively contribute another 53 percent. Together, countries regions enjoy competitive advantage virtually every supply chain segment. China's market share quality low? rivals latest technology. China not. declared high-end semiconductors strategic industry early 2000s, Chinese government understands developing capabilities sector decades-long process. education, long-term battle won, China behind. According Hongbin Li, et al.'s article 'Human Capital China's Future Growth' Journal Economic Perspectives, United States, 90 percent labor force composed high school graduates; college graduates make 45 percent (as 2015). China, college graduates high school graduates made 12.5 percent 28.8 percent, respectively, workforce. China's high school college graduate numbers lower Mexico, South Africa, Philippines, Malaysia. Although China's level innovation high compared developing countries, China cannot effectively compete developed countries low education rates. Lastly, unclear whether Chinese government's investment worth return. Even United States' recent effort bring semiconductor manufacturing back home, incentives Chinese semiconductor companies dwarf offered America. Analyst Peter Cowhey puts way: …the outsized Chinese government support semiconductor industry becomes even starkly apparent comparing value total funding assistance percentage nations'/regions' value global semiconductor sales. measure, China's government assistance semiconductor industry equivalent 137 percent Chinese semiconductor industry's global sales, compared 11 percent Japan, 3.8 percent Taiwan, 2.3 percent European Union, miniscule 0.01 percent South Korea United States.

First, seeks recognized great power status domestically states. Middle East strategically important region, China's engagement seen way increase influence stake global order. Second, aimed secure economic interests region BRI framework continued access energy resources heavily dependent . BRI thus means China increase channels exporting goods, reduce trade friction, improve access natural resources, build supply chains, generate opportunities Chinese companies invest overseas sell goods services. end, past ten years, integrated BRI framework Middle East countries' national development strategies. BRI long-term initiative continue evolve coming years, Beijing need carefully assess success impact projects Middle East make informed decisions proceed. success framework Middle East depends several factors, including economic political stability region, quality BRI projects, willingness host countries cooperate China. importantly, BRI projects essential underdeveloped Middle East states dependent external creditors establish critical physical digital infrastructures. projects already operation entering second third phases development.

Assessing BRI Projects Middle East Currently, BRI projects span fifteen Middle East nations include major infrastructural digital projects land sea. status projects varies, planned, ongoing, completed, halted, canceled, providing insight present overall situation BRI. Developing deeper understanding challenging, however, due 1) deliberate opacity surrounding BRI projects Chinese host regional countries' sides 2) sheer scale initiative, spans large swathes continents. lack transparency major challenge researchers policymakers trying understand BRI implications. Nonetheless, still great amount information available consider.

Ethnic tensions often result beliefs Chinese-led projects benefit migrant workers rather local population. Indonesia, instance, Chinese guest workers rose 17,515 2015 30,000 2018.

Nouwens commented, \"The BRI South Asia achieved intended goal ofexporting Chinese industrial overcapacity abroad. 2010-18, example, value Chinese industrial goods exports Pakistan increased USD3.1 billion USD8.2 billion.

Initially, investment directed towards Central Asia Southeast Asia, spreading westward Africa. Since 2018, Latin America South Pacific received lot attention. However, South Asia Southeast Asia ultimately emerged main foci. Earlier month, International Institute Strategic Studies (IISS) issued annual Asia-Pacific Regional Security Assessment. Meia Nouwens, Senior Fellow Chinese Security Defense Policy IISS, contributed chapter entitled \\'s Decade on. Nouwens discussed implications four key regions. Beginning Southeast Asia, said region remain Beijing\\'s chief area strategic importance. ASEAN\\'s largest trading partner since 2009, bloc \\'s largest trading partner since 2020. Maritime routes run Southeast Asian chokepoints too, encouraging push railways alternative. Key recipients Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Philippines Vietnam.

Western countries leery adopting Chinese 5G telecommunication networks, case many developing countries. Nonetheless, exerts tighter control domestic private-sector technology companies, complicate ability execute projects overseas. USA\\'s stricter regulation semiconductor microchip technologies also complicate \\'s ambitions. According Nouwens, fear economic dependency, ethnic tensions, project build quality corporate social responsibility remain troubling issues . Ethnic tensions often result beliefs Chinese-led projects benefit migrant workers rather local population. Indonesia, instance, Chinese guest workers rose 17,515 2015 30,000 2018. Considering South Asia region, unsurprisingly Pakistan received lion\\'s share investment, absorbing half money. \\'s heavy investment road, rail pipeline infrastructure Himalayas part -Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) paying economic dividends, however. Indeed, far expensive transport products overland Pakistan traditional sea routes. instance, shifting 200,000 barrels crude oil per day via Burma- pipeline, 250,000 barrels daily Pakistan- pipeline, would lose approximately USD1 billion per year compared traditional seaborne tanker route. Another estimate predicts shipping oil Persian Gulf \\'s east coast would cost USD2 per barrel, whereas would cost USD15 per barrel via Pakistan overland pipeline. Nouwens commented, \"The South Asia achieved intended goal exporting Chinese industrial overcapacity abroad. 2010-18, example, value Chinese industrial goods exports Pakistan increased USD3.1 billion USD8.2 billion. Nevertheless, South Asian projects faced security, political, economic, geographic governance challenges.\"Furthermore, \"Chinese investments region necessarily created favourable conditions Beijing\\'s influence.

Nonetheless, oceanic region attracts tiny proportion funds, largest beneficiaries Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands Vanuatu. Nouwens concluded, \"Despite Chinese loans grants sub-region, made minimal impact recipient Pacific Island states. significant shift Chinese investment trade towards sub-region, exception Papua New Guinea.

       " \"overarching belief India Prime Minister Narendra Modi, country emerged global balancer amidst ‘great changes unseen century' – Chinese President Xi Jinping calls reshaping twin global geopolitical economic orders. reality, however, India headed towards strategic isolation irrelevance neighbourhood 2030. two strategic tech-centric decisions taken recent Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) leaders' meeting held margins G-7 summit Japan. first decision collaborate US-led drive telecommunications including 5G 6G, developing ‘standards' critical emerging technologies, especially Artificial Intelligence (AI), cybersecurity. ‘Standards' technology relate commonality hardware, software, platforms interoperability work together. Different tech standards disrupt global supply chain force global companies develop two sets technologies: one meet US developed nations' standards Global North, another Chinese standards supported Russia joined Belt Road Initiative (BRI), Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), BRICS and, generally, major section Global South. Ironically, India – part Quad BRICS/SCO – caught riding two horses. Consequently, Global North consumer nations – especially US European Union (EU) also Japan Australia – face compatibility problems technology development front. thus become increasingly difficult US EU continue present policy ‘de-risk' China – pragmatic version impulse ‘de-couple' . ‘De-risk' refers China's exclusion select technologies like advanced chips, ‘de-couple' means end trade commerce. Moreover, China primary trading partner 138 nations, digital logistics systems built Chinese tech make traditional trade commerce nations following US digital trade standards difficult or, least expensive. Second, part ‘partnership cable connectivity resilience', Quad leverage expertise design, manufacturing, laying maintenance subsea cables secure diversify critical networks. result 'splinternet': separation global internet two sets subsea cables developed maintained, respectively, US China. Together, two Quad decisions – tacitly endorsed G-7 nations – fragment globalisation 2030 far free flow data, trade, capital, human resources concerned, adversely impact third fourth industrial revolutions – concerned mobile internet economy (hardware digital connectivity cyberspace) industrial internet economy (software digital connectivity cyberspace). core Quad decisions cross-border governance debate two issues: cybersecurity cyberspace governance, rules regarding control data, properly handled, enhance nation's innovation power. Meanwhile, China's Digital Silk Road (DSR) announced Xi Jinping 2017 part Belt Road (BRI)'s second phase. Since DSR hardware software cyberspace connectivity, encapsulates third fourth industrial revolutions (or robotics age), hence shift global geopolitical balance power. China's hardware cyberspace connectivity comprises subsea cables, fibre optic cables.

US dynamic structure comparable DSR offers prosperity nations advanced information technology broadband networks, e-commerce hubs, smart cities, efficient ways business on. Obama's pivot towards Asia-Pacific region discussing India South Asia, let's understand genesis tech war two big tech giants. Conscious China's rise, shifted global geopolitics geoeconomics Europe Asia-Pacific region, Obama administration 2011 announced ‘rebalancing' strategy aimed Beijing. ‘pivot' two components: Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), huge trade investment agreement 12 Pacific rim nations, military repositioning, aimed shifting 60% US naval assets Pacific Command (PACOM) Hawaii meet growing challenge People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy (PLAN).

Trump administration's Sputnik Moment came China, July 2017, released super ambitious ‘New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan' become global leader AI 2030. Since emerging technologies converge AI, dual use ushering prosperity fourth industrial revolution changing character war. Thus, progress management AI ecosystems main issue determining global polarity. remains seen whether world remains multipolar – since longer unipolar – moves towards bipolarity end decade, progress AI ecosystems major powers becomes clear. new bipolarity will, course, vastly different Cold War years since would Iron Curtain fragmented globalisation led US China. again, contours unipolarity could emerge second half century. China's 20/30 vision Interestingly, Trump administration failed comprehend Sputnik Moment China come turn century itself, Chinese started using smartphones mass level. Unlike rest world, China moved directly cash payment norm mobile payment without developed credit card system. 2013, 900 million Chinese using mobile internet (smartphones connected 4G wireless internet), population US Europe combined. Thus, 2017, China announced AI plans, mobile internet companies unrivalled consumer data pool made easy convert mobile internet consumers (third industrial revolution) industrial internet enterprises (fourth industrial revolution). Alongside, China's foray international cyberspace connectivity started 2009 junior partner joint venture subsea cables UK-based Global Marine . 2019, China's Huawei Marine Networks completed one hundred projects involving shorter longer trans-Atlantic distances using indigenous advanced subsea cables Chinese acquired expertise laying them. China became fourth largest supplier subsea cables world required assistance foreign partners. Xi Jinping announced Digital Silk Road , worldwide demand subsea cables greater bandwidth increased. China among nations making advances material sciences, optics, data processing enable higher capability submarine-grade fibre. conscious investing heavily advanced subsea cables, terrestrial fibre optic cables, standalone infrastructure Huawei 5G wireless network would allow data flow greater speed, higher volumes, minimal latency compared existing 4G networks. Unlike US, subsea cables private sector, Chinese government backing strategic cyber connectivity plans policies, timelines, resources, subsidies, loans. Since subsea cables carry 95% international data, demand data increased exponentially, high-speed internet expected spur innovation, increase employment opportunities, exploit 5G potential, prepare world 6G connectivity expected commercialised 2030. Four things China got right Starting 2017, China took four important steps left US wondering left behind fourth industrial revolution. One, ushered industrial internet converting internet companies technology companies also helped launch start-ups. optimise digital technologies, Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent among others started cloud services users rent remotely access range computing services including servers, data storage, network, analytics, databases. Realising data strategic resource, Chinese built industrial data centres manufacturing producing data help capabilities traditional industries. Two, Xi, October 2019, attested blockchain technology important breakthrough next round technological innovation industrial transformation. Blockchain distributed digital ledger open anyone join. name suggests, number connected blocks, block three items: data, hash (like fingerprint, unique block), hash previous block. data added deleted block digital ledger, changes get automatically made blocks chain hash also registers it. many checks system, tampering data becomes impossible. makes transactions quick, convenient, controlled, traceable, secure, stable since people chain get know changes made block. 2020, China launched Blockchain Services Network (BSN) , overarching framework wherein various blockchains different services brought one framework digital monitoring. Three, China launched world's first Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), e-Yuan e-Renminbi April 2020 . Digital renminbi world's first digital currency issued country's central bank, case cryptocurrency. Unlike digital wallet system Alipay WeChat, digital renminbi representation actual amount bank, digital wallet. China, thus, created new monetary transfer pathway independent existing ones dominated US like SWIFT system. So, face it, reserve currency (usually US dollars) affected alternate Chinese money transfer system. BRI nations find Chinese payment system faster, cheaper, efficient, importance systems like SWIFT diminish. Eventually, BRI countries business China realise e-Renminbi China's central bank issued currency also ticket China's new digital payment system would supported secure transparent BSN. example, customer BRI nation buys physical containers China, needs make payment digital renminbi. Everything else, customs clearance shipment exact delivery date happen automatically able trace monitor progress. Lastly, China announced dual circulation policy September 2020 . two aspects. first strengthen domestic economy supply chain structural reforms distribution wealth aim bring Chinese people middle class. involved medium companies working digital industrial economy rather big corporations like Alibaba, Weibo, Didi Chuxing technologies. second aspect dual circulation policy foreign investments, free trade agreements, free trade ports engagement outside world encouraged actively sought. dual circulation policy came global criticism—that Communist party want power centres shape huge Chinese corporations. may entirely untrue, point policy sharpen Chinese fourth industrial revolution home sold BRI nations.

Persistent corruption low construction standards created substandard infrastructure trapped several BRI participant countries debt crises. 4 Sri Lanka instructive example. BRI's crown jewel, China made significant investments high-profile infrastructure projects, including deep-water port Hambantota. Trapped unmanageable debt load, Sri Lanka spiraled severe economic crisis. Essential supplies like food, fuel, medicine became scarce. 2017, China took Hambantota port 99-year lease, giving China valuable position monitor Indian Ocean shipping routes.

Unlike American model, uses official government aid, China relied heavily capital sourced development banks state-run commercial lenders. 7 Beijing's behest, institutions sometimes offer below-market interest rates borrowers would otherwise struggle secure funding. result, Chinese institutions underperformed compared global peers. 8 model delivered Beijing strategic benefits, also become headache. Beijing faces scarcity investment capital, China's rapid economic growth extensive borrowing recent decades put risk potential debt crisis. reflected China's high debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio, reached record 279.7 percent first quarter year. 9 Local governments' hidden debt poses challenge Xi.

       " \"China's growing technological expertise along digital silk road expected set benchmarks rest world follow, according analysts.President Xi's ambitious Belt Road Initiative (BRI) started digital silk road long rest world began talking connected smart cities technology driven solutions.As China continues expand digital footprint sectors diverse cloud computing, 5G, surveillance technology virtual currency, observers see movement areas toward Chinese technological dominance.Dale Aluf, Director Research & Strategy SIGNAL (Sino-Israel Global Network & Academic Leadership) said China already leading world artificial intelligence, blockchain, 5G, quantum technology publications patents. 'Data fuels AI development and, thanks sprawling surveillance apparatus, China access immense amounts it, China seems well-positioned emerge leader field.'China already launched biggest blockchain ecosystem world, connected 100 city nodes, first country launch widespread pilots digital fiat currency - Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) system.Analysts agree China achieved enormous breakthroughs future technologies.'These advancements technologies allow China efficiently promote progress BRI, increase bonding China BRI countries, push BRI's hard projects,' said Walter Wang, Consulting Director research consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, Greater China.Wang cited China's world-leading fibre optic industry, already assisting BRI countries transforming traditional renewable energy supplies.Many countries aligned BRI rich solar energy resources, 'lack technologies resources construct renewable energy infrastructure,' according Wang.'Through BRI, China export advanced renewable energy technologies BRI countries Chinese fibre optic enterprises able enjoy local preferential policies, including tax incentives, preferential treatment equipment imports,' added. According Frost & Sullivan research, infrastructure areas, high-speed railway, 5G networks, ultra-high voltage power grids, China's standards become international standards everyone else plays catch-up.'Therefore, collaborating Chinese enterprises, BRI partner countries adopt technologies accord advanced standards infrastructure projects,' said Wang.Impact BRIAccording SIGNAL's Aluf, China's technological prowess gives edge push BRI's hard projects, renewable energy, transportation, infrastructure, power, healthcare since today's technology-driven world, digital realm intimately intertwined hard infrastructure.'Railways, ports, electricity grids, instance, would able operate effectively today without software, sensors, cybersecurity,' notedMoreover, China also provides useful reference BRI countries digital transformation industrial digitalisation models.Wang said BRI countries developing countries limited experience dealing digital technology benefit China's digitalisation experiences.He gave example Silk Road E-commerce platform China developed together 22 BRI countries 2016. COVID-19 pandemic, China, aligned BRI, quickly adjusted strategies, switching focus offline online market, exploiting advantages cross-border e-commerce platforms, creating new growth points economic development BRI countries.In future, Wang expects China continue assisting BRI countries improve 5G infrastructure, foundation future digital transformation, promote digital economies, popularising mobile payments facilitate loan processes SMBs therefore alleviate 'urgent need' financing pandemic.How technology incorporated BRI projects depend much nature projects, according Jia Hao Chan, research associate Lee Kuan Yew School Public Policy, National University Singapore.'And differ among regions countries,' said.For instance, late 2017, Chinese company Huawei Marine partnered Pakistani authorities start constructing Pakistan East Africa Cable Express, connect Pakistan Kenya Djibouti, focusing hard infrastructure interconnectivity.'This essentially different areas China looking Southeast Asia (focusing services, soft infrastructure), tech companies like Alibaba Didi Chuxing would collaborate regional ride-hailing services like Grab, investment partnerships.' TECHNOLOGY EXPORTSGiven BRI primarily financing/investment mechanism, analysts Fitch Solutions believe exporting technology simply adds different dimension entire BRI assistance package.'Broadly speaking, BRI projects already dependent using Chinese equipment labour, kind tech advancement might mean higher quality efficient projects,' said Daine Loh, Analyst, Infrastructure Power & Renewables, Fitch Solutions.She pointed things like 5G AI still early adoption stage broader infrastructure sector, adding, 'we expect widely used yet'.Loh said anything digital tend also require larger investment amount, 'the financial capacity BRI recipient markets come question well, especially markets prioritising developing adequate infrastructure meet domestic needs first'.The best way BRI partner countries benefit China's technological prowess partner Chinese operators, according Chris Devonshire Ellis, Chairman Dezan Shira & Associates.'In West, capitalist system focused much profits enough cashflow business service lines. Chinese developing technologies hook services supply chains generate cash flow streams. sustainable business model,' said.LIMITS SHARINGWhile China achieved digital supremacy areas future tech, much shared BRI partner countries remains seen. developing countries able take advantage ICT infrastructure, China 'will share ownership technology drives infrastructure,' according Andre Wheeler.'The technology owned China National Security legislative provisions. may act barrier future trade developing countries may restricted conduct trade likes EU,' said Wheeler, also chief executive Asia Pacific Connex.The Digital Silk Road, BRI supply-driven project, noted researcher Chan. added China's technological offers guarantee level adoption (demand) tech goods services across partner countries.'Moreover, could lag effect tech exports, certain technologies gain foothold Chinese market deployed elsewhere.'Hence, Chan suggested BRI partner countries carefully consider 'what really need' merely 'take whatever put table'. 'They also consider ability adopt technologies want, rate innovation going attain competitive advantage long run.'According Wheeler, digital silk road integrator trade along BRI – something developed create integrated seamless trade platform BRI participants.'It powerful targets key merge points transport systems, particularly ports rail.'However, points shortcomings DSR/BRI integration could limit China BRI partner countries regional role.Whilst EU–China Comprehensive Agreement Investment (CAI) agreement principle heralded January means cooperation, Wheeler said also significant pushback EU, regards recently introduced EU-Connectivity strategy led likes Huawei banned network provider EU digital connectivity initiatives.MAKING INROADSBut many countries already enjoying benefits China's augmentation infrastructure tech.Aluf SIGNAL pointed several Middle Eastern countries cooperating China smart city technology, even project designed streamline experiences pilgrims travelling Mecca Medina.'China's 2Africa initiative, among largest subsea projects world, aims connect 23 countries Africa, Middle East Europe resource-efficient fibre optic cable uses Spatial Division Multiplexing technology,' added.Meanwhile, SeaMeWe-5 undersea cable expected carry telecommunications Singapore France.According Frost & Sullivan's Wang, BRI partner countries outdated data infrastructure, means operational efficiency low maintenance costs relatively expensive.For long-term development, countries need upgrade existing infrastructure well initiate new infrastructure projects.'China, pioneer, provide countries necessary technologies, financing and, importantly, practical experiences,' said Wang.For example, said, China Republic Belarus jointly built industrial parks based industrial Internet. China also transportation internet infrastructure upgrading projects Iran, Pakistan, Vietnam, Brazil, Malaysia. 'Thus, support China, BRI partner countries accelerate infrastructure upgrading process build information systems,' added Wang.BEYOND TECH SUPREMACY China's dominance future technologies continue grow one overlooked aspect BRI, according Ellis, turn China global supply chain middleman.'It making products building infrastructure, operate much it. 'Everything someone buys Paris London price component charged Chinese business,' said.While seems tendency observers focus specific technologies impacts given tech economic sector, Aluf insists true power technologies unleashed augmentation.For example, combining embedded sensors, metering devices, cameras, surveillance tech big data processing aggregated data analysis, said China emerged forefront smart city development. 'The said fintech sector, companies like Huawei, Tencent, Alibaba leading way.'With China doubling achieving carbon neutrality, Aluf said also expected pump significant resources development clean technologies renewable energy.FUTURE INVESTMENTS terms investment BRI, China likely increase funding soft infrastructure Digital Silk Route said necessarily form intergovernmental (G2G), government-to-business (G2B) industry-wide coordinated approach. 'They form B2B company level.'He said Chinese tech companies already investing many local/regional tech companies.At government level, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang March declared China increase spending research development 7 percent next five years push make major breakthroughs advanced technology.At time, part post-COVID-19 relief package, Aluf says China ramping plans construct digital infrastructure grids across country – including building 5G networks, artificial intelligence (AI), Internet Things (IoT), intercity high-speed rail, setting research development institutions.'Considering importance China's international digital expansion context global strategy, think likely China increase funding digital infrastructure banner Digital Silk Road,' added.While COVID-19 pandemic greatly affected world economy, China's non-financial outward foreign direct investment BRI partner countries remained strong positive, reaching $17.8 billion 2020, 18.3 percent increase 2019, stated Frost & Sullivan.In first half 2021, China's non-financial outward foreign direct investment BRI partner countries continued growing $9.6 billion, growth rate 8.6 percent.'Based historical data, consider China's spending BRI partner countries keep rising, cooperation effective comprehensive,' said Wang.In foreseeable future, said communications data infrastructure levels BRI partner countries largely influence development BRI. 'Therefore, China continue raising funding soft infrastructure ensure success BRI.'WEAK SPOTSBut China's quest technological leadership without challenges. weak spot technology hardware allows future technologies work, like instance, microprocessor/semi-conductor capacity, involves fitting transistors single microchip effectively handle large data flow/information exchange.Wheeler pointed chip design dominated US South Korea, five top seven design centres US-owned, Taiwan South Korea, them, control 75 percent world semi-conductor manufacturing capacity.'China currently trying change agenda discussion, technology development, argue better chip utility. significant issue integrated circuitry chip technology central smartphone development use IoT/AI etc – significant hurdle China move develop advanced 6G network,' explained.Aluf noted China's push achieve technological supremacy drive global standards raised concerns quarters.'Against backdrop renewed great power competition, West, particularly America, determined maintain lead development standard setting emerging technologies,' said.He opined America's Build Back Better (B3W) plan, projected worth $7 trillion, may serve counterweight BRI.'If successful, could dilute influence BRI projects - including digital realm,' said.(Writing SA Kader; Editing Charles Lavery Anoop Menon) (anoop.menon@refinitiv.com) © ZAWYA 2022\",\n",

Chinese companies Nigeria Nigeria said largest African economy one fastest-growing markets continent. 1990s 'Going Out' period, Chinese companies Huawei ZTE rapidly grown presence African continent, experts linking growth cheaper products services offered companies. However, observers noted China's penetration Africa seen within context Digital Silk Road (DSR) programme, launched 2015. DSR said introduced 2015 official Chinese government white paper, component Beijing's Belt Road Initiative (BRI). programme delivers digital infrastructure, including fibreoptic cables, data centres indeed next-generation cellular networks, partner countries. report 2018 disclosed DSR-related investments digital infrastructure projects outside China reached $79 billion. Interestingly, Nigeria, Zambia, Angola, Ethiopia Zimbabwe benefited project, estimated investment value totalling $8.43bn. According 2018 study conducted Infrastructure Consortium Africa, African governments, China continent's second-largest source infrastructure financing, committing $25.7bn African countries year. Also, 50 percent Africa's 3G networks 70 percent 4G networks built Huawei, world's leading seller 5G technology smartphones, 2021 April Report Atlantic Council's Africa Center disclosed.

ICT expert, Ahmad Galadima said Nigeria attractive investors Africa's populous country. According him, success MTN, Airtel 9mobile shown Nigeria biggest market terms telecom Africa. 'The huge internet penetration Nigeria creates huge potential businesses.' stated. Since launching business operations Nigeria 1999, Huawei invested US$76 million within country. company also selected Nigerian government core partner building smart cities e-government applications 'reshape way public services provided managed' within country. 'China developed technology economy well industry. looking markets outside country. China invests heavily many areas. China invest hugely Nigeria, mean know does, great opportunity,' Director, Institute Legislative Studies, University Abuja, Prof. Sheriff Ghali Ibrahim said. Ibrahim observed China's Investment Nigeria result country largest technology Africa information telecommunication infrastructure deficit. addition, Huawei, acclaimed Seeds Future global Corporate Social Responsibility program, trained 600 students 14 sub-Saharan countries covering emerging ICT technologies 5G, cloud computing, AI. programme launched 2008 aimed help nurture local talent, promote knowledge transfer, increase people's understanding interest ICT industry, encourage countries regions participate digital community building. 2017, ten Nigerian students sponsored China Huawei major ICT-related studies practical ICT insights. students said selected signed Huawei Authorised Information Network Academy (HAINA) Huawei ICT Academy, including students University Lagos, University Benin University Nsukka, Nigeria.

Marco Polo encountered money made 'bark trees' circulating universally within Mongol empire Yuan Dynasty, one hundred years later, witnessed financial system efficient, long distance transactions, central banking authority complete trust population. Today, world cusp another technological revolution humans conduct commerce. Again, China fore, leading way cash cryptocurrency new central bank digital currency (CBDC), e-CNY, commonly known digital yuan. Although US dollar remains world's dominant fiat currency, analysis geopolitics surrounding battle currency hegemony reveals China's digital yuan pose serious challenge dollar status quo 21st century unfolds.The Digital YuanChina's 13th Five Year Plan, covering 2016 2020, aimed 'promote RMB [Chinese currency] internationalization see RMB capital go global.' China's motivations RMB internationalization include escaping US monetary policy, shoring dollar shortages, gaining lower borrowing costs. 2009 2019, 20 trillion yuan exchanged across borders. Still, RMB makes mere two percent global foreign reserves compared dollar's sixty percent. basic prerequisite reserve currency backing large economy, high trade volume, net creditor status (meaning country's international investments larger foreign debt owe). China lags behind United States GDP trade volume fifteen percent net creditor compared United States' eighty percent net debtor position. Beyond pure economic calculus, however, currency hegemony relies balance factors still remain squarely favor dollar. Crucially, China's rule law, trustworthiness, tightly controlled economy make investors skittish relying Chinese currency. What, then, China's path internationally formidable RMB?The answer may lie China's digital yuan. cryptocurrency development eight years, since People's Bank China (PBoC) began investigating government-run bitcoin 2014. early 2010s, Chinese crypto miners responsible estimated 95 percent newly minted bitcoin. Chinese government discovered mining activity 2012 investigating suspicious power usage, bitcoin mining extremely energy intensive. decentralized, anonymous currency posed major threat China's strict social financial controls. officials started banning regulating cryptocurrency, also saw potential. 2021, private cryptocurrency activity banned Chinese economy also largely transitioned away paper yuan. Last year, 80 percent Chinese adults made digital payments. Testing digital yuan began 2020, early adoption numbers less encouraging Chinese officials may hoped for. October 2021, total 123 million individual wallets, although average sum 47 cents (three RMB) implying many consumers actively using new currency. Adoption numbers doubled January 2022 lead-up Winter Olympics hosted Beijing. China planned use Olympics introduce world digital yuan, similar country's extravagant displays 2008 thrust modern China onto global stage. Due China's stringent covid policies, foreign visitors actually attendance. Still, PBoC reported around $300,000 (2 million RMB) daily transactions digital yuan throughout games. Although dwarfed domestically China's primary digital payment companies, AliPay TenPay, China's ambitions digital yuan undoubtedly international. Geopolitics Currency HegemonyThe battle currency hegemony better characterized insurgency Cold War, China may willing employ geopolitical tactics outmaneuver current-standing hegemon. three primary ways China could leverage geopolitical clout achieve RMB internationalization digital yuan.The first strongest lever available China Belt Road Initiative (BRI). Announced 2013 Xi Jinping's capstone foreign policy project, BRI projected lifetime spending one trillion dollars. initiative consists overland economic belt maritime silk road encompasses estimated 60 countries comprise two-thirds world's population. domestic goals BRI largely economic. China overcapacity raw materials steel coal producers desperate new export markets. BRI also aims economically develop impoverished regions western China part trade routes planned central Asia. economic goals alone justify initiative's price tag, however, foreign policy ambitions inherent BRI vast.Regionally, China hopes counter U.S. 'pivot Asia' started Obama Administration's strengthening economic ties neighboring countries fostering new investment opportunities. Globally, China aims finance infrastructure spending developing countries, thus currying favor potentially gaining political leverage recipient nations. practice, sometimes referred 'debt-trap diplomacy,' recently criticized contributing Sri Lanka's economic crisis.China also planning use BRI internationalize RMB. Indeed, majority BRI project recipients showed interest settling cross-border transactions using RMB. digital yuan comes in. According researcher Mahima Duggal, BRI 'perfect mechanism accelerating international use digital yuan.' many developing countries, banking infrastructure severely lacking transactions take weeks. digital yuan bypasses third-party banks local institutions practically eliminates fees executing transactions instantly. Stanley Chao, expert business Asia, says many countries within BRI would 'jump idea' adopting digital yuan. Another facet BRI Digital Silk Road (DSR), aims export Chinese technology BRI participants including high speed internet, artificial intelligence, mobile payment systems similar China's AliPay. Chinese technology comes Chinese control, many technology firms China nominally private sector. greater control country's digital infrastructure widespread use digital yuan, Duggal writes China could even 'rewire financial networks' countries heavily involved BRI.China's BRI primarily foreign policy outreach program aimed developing new allies gaining influence emerging markets. project ambitious currency hegemony, China also turning old allies help implement international CBDC. majority countries members International Monetary Fund (IMF) currently investigating CBDC already developed one. Many CBDCs limited domestic use, China one first countries seriously evaluating cross-border transactions using CBDC, crucial first step towards global adoption. experimentation spawned multiple CBDC, mCBDC, bridge project, collaboration four financial jurisdictions—China, Hong Kong, Thailand, UAE—that aims create infrastructure facilitate efficient, low cost transfers CBDCs respecting existing regulations privacy norms within jurisdiction. project identified 15 use cases CBDC transfers countries including commercial payments, wealth management, bond issuance, trade settlements, supply chain financing. Several financial institutions participating mCBDC Goldman Sachs (US), HSBC (UK), UBS (Switzerland), based western economies. potentially indicates broader reach collaboration simply Chinese allies regional banks.Lastly, international sanctions present unique opportunity China showcase advantages currency outside US control. Russia invaded Ukraine, one way United States retaliated cutting Russia Society Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT). SWIFT responsible nearly international cross-border transactions. 95 percent dollar payments settled New York, SWIFT policed US. White House vowed without SWIFT, Russia would reliant 'the telephone fax machine' conduct international business. digital yuan offers potential solution. bypassing SWIFT executing secure cross-border transfer using China's CBDC, Russia could theoretically trade anyone willing run afoul US sanctions. China target widespread sanctions, digital yuan could crucial continuing trade relations close allies. China could also pitch digital yuan countries seeking disrupt US hegemony, ally Iran. support digital yuan increases reach recognition, turn boosting internationalization RMB. Playing Catch-upRegardless present shortcomings China's CBDC experimentation, United States may far behind producing viable competitor. digital yuan already debuted international stage March 2022, Biden issued executive order begin investigating US CBDC. Although United States dominant market player privately traded cryptocurrencies, spent past decade seriously researching testing CBDCs China has. hope, early versions US CBDC developed conjunction MIT proven sophisticated digital yuan, able handle five times transactions per second. technology still far traded across borders, however. now, Vice President Beijing-based cryptocurrency firm Ian Wittkop writes, CBDCs 'a field one.' post-pandemic world, trends e-commerce, social media, remote work, clear world becoming digital. financial system dominated CBDCs and, extension, China, could become inevitable reality.\",\n",

IntroductionAs new type trade, digital trade become important focus promoting China's opening economic progress. development Maritime Silk Road plays vital role strengthening international regional economic cooperation [1]. Therefore, exploring trade competition trade potential China countries along Maritime Silk Road momentous practical significance promoting China's economic growth regional economic cooperation among countries along route [2]. process sailing sea, ship faces complex changeable marine environment. properly scheduling ship network realizing manipulation overall control system stable sailing ship ensured [3]. time, affected digital trade barriers, certain obstacles global trade. Research reducing obstacles improving ship network scheduling plays significant role development international trade construction [4].At present, scholars made studies maritime transportation network scheduling. Yang et al. [5] conducted detailed study resource management scheduling maritime networks using deep learning (DL) algorithm combined optimal link selection scheme Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) [5]. Zhang et al. [6–8] proposed new intelligent effective method based improved Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) solve optimization problem path multiobjective ships [6]. Shang et al. [9] proposed DL-based energy optimization scheduling method ship power systems, simulation experiments, effectiveness superiority optimal scheduling method verified [9]. Peng et al.

Finally, test message delivery rate ship TTCAN protocol analyzed. Meanwhile, constructing time-varying stochastic frontier gravity model, detailed comparison international digital trade potential China countries along western route Maritime Silk Road carried out. innovation research lies constructing optimization process ship network scheduling Maritime Silk Road based improved GA SAA, time-varying stochastic frontier gravity model used analyze trade potential. aimed providing reference research international digital trade maritime transportation networks China countries along Maritime Silk Road.2. Research Theoretical Basis Model Method2.1. Maritime Silk Road Theory Digital Trade BarriersThe 'Maritime Silk Road 21st Century' includes two parts: first part westward, China's coastal ports South China Sea, Indian Ocean, finally extending Europe. second part southward, China's coastal ports South China Sea South Pacific. terms international trade, western route already foundation cooperation, many large-scale projects implemented. countries western route responded positively policy, political mutual trust two sides relatively high [7]. analyze scale digital trade exports, 21 countries along Silk Road selected divided four regions according traditional geography, shown Figure 1.In Figure 1, Southeast Asia includes Singapore Malaysia. Central Asia includes Kyrgyzstan. West Asia North Africa cover Turkey, Israel, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Greece. Eastern Europe involves Russia, Bulgaria, Belarus, Hungary, Croatia, Poland, Serbia, Lithuania, Estonia, Slovenia, Latvia, Czech Republic, Slovakia [15].2.2. International Digital TradeDigital trade driven globalization, new technologies, new demands, new rules global trade governance. help Internet platforms, intellectual property-intensive products services used trade objects. continuous development technologies big data cloud computing, forms digital trade gradually enriched. Figure 2 indicates connotation digital trade three dimensions: mode, content, subject trade [16].In Figure 2, perspective trade mode, digital trade divided digital ordering, digital delivery, platform support. viewpoint trade mode, digital trade covers split goods, information, services. point trade subject, digital trade involves three levels: enterprise, individual, government.Although digital trade great potential development, digital trade covers information data various industries communications, public services, finance, involves personal privacy national security, still many digital trade barriers various countries certain extent. Trade barriers restrictions importation goods services. Digital trade barriers mainly manage control information data [17]. Digital trade barriers manifest different forms, expressed Figure 3.As portrayed Figure 3, first localization requirements enterprises. Enterprises need store manage data countries. second market access control; mainly, government regulates inflow foreign companies domestic market. third personal information protection policy. government uses series means improve level information security effectively supervise manage data. fourth issue intellectual property rights, mainly issues patents related intellectual property rights involved digital trade. fifth uncertainty legal liability, makes easy cause disputes tortious acts. sixth censorship measures. government use effective censorship measures restrict online information inquiries. seventh customs measures, means relevant measures customs unclear complex [8].2.3. Process GAGA incorporates theory 'survival fittest' characteristics self-adaptation, randomness, high parallelism [18]. GA uses evolution process 'chromosome' survival fittest simulate process problem-solving. iteration population, chromosomes evaluated pros cons. many iterations, optimal solution problem finally obtained [19]. process GA exhibited Figure 4.In Figure 4, parameters input first, number iterations set 0. set chromosomes randomly generated initial population, fitness values chromosomes population calculated. Then, determined whether termination criterion met. satisfied, calculation stopped output optimal result, solution process ends; not, next step executed.

IntroductionThe Silk Road long history, since inception Han Dynasty, trade route spans three continents: Asia, Africa, Europe [1]. However, passage time influence human activities, ecological environment along Silk Road changed greatly years, especially due serious land degradation increase desert area, become serious prominent environmental problems along route. Therefore, redevelop economy along Silk Road, environment energy prominent issues stage [2–4]. Therefore, full-scale construction Silk Road belt, necessary break obstacle environmental energy problems development plan development strategy meet possible challenges [5].Nowadays, economic globalization trade liberalization gradually increasing, traditional trade barriers tariffs, quotas, licenses weakened, followed rapid momentum trade protectionism based trade barriers, increasingly affects smooth flow economic trade [6–9]. developed countries take advantage differences developing countries terms environmental standards technology levels set harsh, complicated, unfair product standards import export regulations restrict introduction products countries, forming tight comprehensive trade protection network [10]. name protecting global ecological environment, trade barriers intentionally used developed countries disguise trade barriers complex reasonable legal forms national trade protection. developed countries take advantage deficiencies developing countries science technology set product standards developing countries' products cannot reach trade barriers products developing countries suffer certain losses obstacles export trade [11]. So, seems continuous establishment trade barriers great negative impact export products, become one serious problems trade barriers encountered China since accession WTO. Therefore, face growing trend trade barriers, achieve production, improve level sustainable development, breakthrough restrictions losses brought trade barriers developed countries become important issue facing China current international trade activities urgently needs resolved. gradual development Silk Road, promote countries along route break global trade barriers realize development Silk Road pressing issue [12–14].According respective definitions meaning green development, domestic foreign scholars proposed green development indexes evaluation index systems different perspectives. Foreign global institutions already incorporated theories sustainable economy green development early stage analyzed green development levels green development level assessment models. Reference [15] proposed eco-efficiency index system determine relationship economic development, natural resources, ecological environment Asia-Pacific region. Reference [16] proposed DPSIR assessment model evaluate sustainable development. model based economic, social, cultural contexts completes causal chain drivers (D), pressures (P), conditions (S), effects (1), responses ®, examines impact environment people's lives economy society change. United Nations Bureau Statistics (1993) (28) published handbook calculating overall environmental economy, includes environmental economic balance, degree exploitation natural resources, degree environmental damage [17]. environmental resource utilization rate, living standards, economic development potential, government policies, natural resources first level assessment indicators, 14 secondary coefficients 23 tertiary coefficients, together build sustainable development monitoring coefficient model includes economic, social, living aspects. basis OECD's green development monitoring coefficient model, many countries continuously improved coefficient model line actual situation.Nowadays, China's green development models focus economic growth, resource development, natural ecology.

Rather well-defined set projects, China's digital initiative seems umbrella term collection telecommunications data-related products services delivered China-based companies. Digital Silk Road, Jonathan Hillman delves key features China's digital expansion terms ‘the network wars' opposing United States China. Assiduously researched compellingly written, book starts examining rise China technological superpower, provides description ‘the battlefield', ends offering suggestions America emerge triumphantly. seven chapters, Hillman covers many aspects Digital Silk Road, ranging Huawei-installed networks Glasgow, Montana, submarine cable connecting Pakistan East Africa Europe; BeiDou Satellite systems safe city surveillance equipment Hangzhou, well facial-recognition software used repress predominantly Muslim Uyghurs Xinjiang. Entitled ‘CTR +C', second chapter worth mentioning depiction Huawei's rise unique case copying stealing. Beyond benefiting generous government subsidies, documents Huawei stole secrets competitors' laboratories, showrooms computers. also poached top engineers hired coaching services IBM US firms improve internal management. Here, Hillman succumbs common pitfall picturing technological imitation Chinese characteristic, culturally driven practice defines Chinese firms. means specific China. history late development, catching up, one emulation, reversed engineering, indeed outright stealing. US applied strict protectionist measures 19th century continued copying British inventions long independence. book sheds light stories marginalized communities US, left American market-based approach telecommunications coverage. communities, like developing countries, left better alternative Chinese companies Huawei, provide financially competitive services. Hillman argues developing countries disadvantaged groups, data security secondary issue, priority. Ultimately, choice providers comes price. heart Digital Silk Road lies unsubstantiated claim global digital data could secure collected, stored controlled western companies allies. Yet, remains unclear expensive, US-based tech firms would represent safer options developing countries. shown Edward Snowden, US National Security Agency accessed data millions people, America abroad, tapping directly servers Facebook, Google, Microsoft Yahoo, among others. far, evidence similar global surveillance programme conducted Beijing. say Chinese engage spying – certainly – everyone else.

Behind Great Firewall, Hillman provides thorough account increasingly controlled internet content removals, restrictions use virtual private networks, account closures systematic user-tracing arrests. Far early hypothesis internet would usher wave democratic transformations, including China, Chinese Communist Party managed use digital technologies contain dissent consolidate grip power. According Hillman, China currently charm offensive export authoritarian internet governance model developing countries. framing China active promoter internet model seems convincing, interpretation rests largely assumptions. instance, Iginio Gagliardone's China, Africa Future Internet shows China's presence Africa's digital space taken different forms, China supporting locally rooted visions information society, adapting adjusting democratic autocratic settings. related concern Digital Silk Road idea ‘China' homogenous entity clearly defined project, master plan conquer global internet. Hillman's characterization China vague assumes intrinsic characteristics apply Chinese actors. distinction drawn private state-owned firms. account, Communist Party pulls strings. However, 2020 Chinese crackdown tech titans suggests complex story. Alibaba, China's giant e-commerce group, fined $2.8 billion breaching anti-monopoly rules, Jack Ma, co-founder chief executive, China's richest man, forced lay low several months. Strict new regulations targeting Chinese tech companies, taxi-hailing apps online-tuition platforms, mirror CCP's desire rein power digital capital indicate existing tensions state's interests digital entrepreneurs. Hillman concludes policy solutions allow America win ongoing ‘network war'. Recognizing information empire emerged without active state behind it, author calls industrial policy supporting US tech firms. also suggests creation large coalition democratic countries, reminiscent Cold War grouping, curtail China's digital authoritarianism. Beyond Hillman's alarmist discourse Manichean language dividing global internet two distinct camps, lies nuanced reality.

Perhaps important Belt Road Initiative. Belt Road Initiative (BRI, also called One Belt One Road), Xi announced great fanfare 2013, initially consisted two major components: Silk Road Economic Belt 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. initiatives added recent years, including Digital Silk Road, Arctic Silk Road, Health Silk Road, Space Silk Road. 'silk road' useful metaphor ChiComs, carries historical, cultural, psychological ramifications exploited propagandized (for example, Westerners know Marco Polo was). ancient Silk Road existed 1,400 years, connecting China East Asia Europe Middle East. purpose promotion two-way trade commerce providing overland transportation network facilitate distribution storage trade goods along routes. ancient Silk Road fell disuse severed Turks captured Constantinople (now Istanbul). BRI modern version ancient Silk Road intended interlink Central Asia common economic market dominated Beijing; expand authoritarian Chinese mercantilist system Europe, Middle East, Africa order replace existing Western international rules-based order. general view Trieste Old Port Trieste, Italy, April 2, 2019. historic city Trieste preparing open new port China, Italy becoming first G-7 nation sign China's Belt Road infrastructure project. (Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images) overarching BRI objective develop global infrastructure controlled China, various 'roads' serving spokes wheel service hub (mainland China). Another analogy would spider's web expanding ever outward, Beijing (the 'Spider Dragon') center web. infrastructure elements largely focused development transportation assets later exploited Beijing transport resources raw materials needed fuel Chinese manufacturing concerns, well support exportation finished Chinese goods overseas markets around world, including roads, ports, railroads, bridges, etc. BRI investments also include renewable energy projects, communications infrastructures, cultural exchanges. Silk Roads promote controlling worldwide technology standards, dominating Arctic trade routes, influencing worldwide health initiatives ways profitable communist China, exploitation space technologies People's Liberation Army. described here, ChiComs believe BRI ticket worldwide economic hegemony future 'controlling access key resources, exporting idle industrial capacity, even tilting world order favor.' last observation key BRI, Xi envisions China becoming world's preeminent economic superpower not-too-distant future, personal prestige tightly intertwined success nearly $1 trillion planned investment 138 countries around world (and counting). Green Belt Road Initiative Center reported January 'Chinese investments 138 countries Belt Road Initiative show overall investments BRI 2020 US$47 billion.' Thus, ChiComs' mercantilist authoritarian capitalist spiderweb extended two-thirds world's 195 countries (and counting). Chinese investments associated BRI come strings attached, grants rather loans must paid back. Countries receiving investments often pay back loans granting Chinese long-term exploitation rights natural resources and/or long-term lease arrangement ports, railroads, infrastructure developed using BRI loans. ChiComs' loan-payback mechanism frequently described 'debt-trap diplomacy,' excellent summary works provided here. debt trap problem also exacerbated developing countries ruled corrupt dictators siphon BRI loans private accounts instead intended use infrastructure development.

Digital Silk Road ties directly another major initiative, China Standards 2035, aims 'set global rules across industries, especially emerging technologies.' Control standards; control technologies. noted here, Xi continues repeat platitudes 'multilateral cooperation trade investment' 'closer partnership openness inclusiveness' whenever discusses 'high quality Belt Road cooperation.' uses latest buzzwords motivate Westerners days, too, including 'green clean,' 'people-centered,' 'sustainable' without ever defining exactly terms really mean. reality, words phrases window dressing mask ChiCom intentions aimed squarely access control natural resources intimidation BRI 'partners' bills Chinese loans come due. public pronouncements, Xi openly propagandized supposed altruism Chinese Communist Party (CCP) pursuing BRI, reality opposite—just Xi's grandiose announcements involving multilateral cooperation, mutual benefits, 'shared future' mankind. Xi neglects state 'shared future' arranged CCP's terms, existing free market-based international order. CCP's view 'sharing future' China 'share – control' countries provide natural resources needed fuel Chinese industry, BRI debt traps mechanisms effect 'sharing.' Captive Nations Coalition Committee Present Danger: China perfectly deciphers 'Xi-speak' BRI first annual report (emphasis added): 'The practical effect, therefore, debt-trap enabled build-out global Chinese colonial empire.' Conclusion Silk road, hub-and spoke, spiderweb, Spider Dragon (Beijing)—all roads lead communist China. ChiCom altruism really ChiCom control, BRI aimed squarely latter, former!

[Photo provided China Daily] Belt Road Initiative (BRI) remains one China's important global programs. past, efforts related promoting primary targets initiative, land-based Silk Road Economic Belt sea-based 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. recent years, China expanded efforts introduction Digital Silk Road, Green Silk Road, Health Silk Road Polar Silk Road. Developments four areas already changed BRI landscape. Delving specific dimensions BRI demonstrate initiative's future roadmap showcase clear picture relevant investment implications. Among four pillars introduced respectively digital, green, health polar, Green Silk Road looks make BRI projects greener sustainable. Chinese policymakers increasingly focused sustainable BRI recent years. scope Green Silk Road includes reducing carbon emissions, cutting pollution protecting biodiversity, also ensuring improved economic opportunities countries involved. believe three main reasons behind China's push develop Green Silk Road. First, fits growing global trend prioritizing sustainable development. Green Silk Road viewed effective solution promote implementation United Nations' 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development. Green Silk Road also serves key enabler China seeks achieve goals peaking carbon dioxide emissions 2030 achieving carbon neutrality 2060. Climate change one humanity's greatest challenges concerted efforts required globally, especially emerging developing economies. countries face rising energy needs grow, industrialize urbanize. Infrastructure investment decisions today lock emissions trajectories decades make break ability countries achieve sustainability objectives. underscores importance Green Silk Road driving sustainable development Belt Road region. Second, since launch BRI, Western academia civil society voiced concerns alleged environmental impacts extensive infrastructure development. Green Silk Road response criticism lays solid foundation wider global recognition BRI. Third, many countries involved BRI lagging terms sustainable development. China's emphasis Green Silk Road allows country set green standards BRI projects make sustainability defining feature BRI cooperation agreements. Looking back, witnessed Green Silk Road progress demonstrates great efforts undertaken broader sense. Chinese officials actively promoted Green Silk Road setting various guidelines partnership agreements. late 2018, China released Green Investment Principles (GIP) BRI — set principles greener investments countries regions participating BRI. June 2021, 39 large international financial institutions embraced GIP. 2019, BRI International Green Development Coalition established engage dialogue, exchanges, joint research, capacity building activities. since attracted 150 Chinese foreign partners 40 countries, garnered positive response widespread support international community. mid-2021, China also published Green Development Guidelines Overseas Investment Cooperation Guidelines Ecological Environmental Protection Foreign Investment Cooperation Construction Projects. two programs focus environmental risk management overseas BRI projects supply chains. key aspect BRI, Chinese officials also shown significant commitment toward making energy investments BRI regions sustainable. mainly executed two ways — reducing coal-related investments increasing green energy investments. Since Chinese officials declared intention minimizing financing coal power plants abroad, coal-related investments construction projects dropped around zero 2021 2022.China also highly committed investments renewable energy solar, wind hydropower BRI-involved regions, increased 50 percent year-on-year 2022. China dominates global manufacturing industry renewables, accounting 72 percent global solar manufacturing 50 percent global wind turbine manufacturing. thus well-positioned help deliver low-carbon technologies BRI countries regions. Chinese officials also cooperated local governments corporations countries regions involved BRI build green infrastructure. One notable example Lower Stung Russei Chrum hydropower station Koh Kong province, Cambodia, built owned large Chinese electric company. station entered commercial operation 2013 total installed capacity 338 megawatts annual output 1.2 billion kilowatt-hours. operation since mid-2022, project generated 8.4 billion kWh clean power helped advance Cambodia's transition toward greater use renewable energy. Another example involves technological innovation renewable energy sector floating solar farm Huainan, Anhui province. site's 160,000 solar panels installed 2017 large domestic renewable energy storage company covering huge surface area water formerly site coal mine. solar panels generate 150 megawatts electricity year, equivalent 53,000 metric tons coal, demonstrating potential solar projects along Green Silk Road. Given efforts mentioned thus far, expect China's BRI projects become greener sustainable long term. believe developments across countries regions involved BRI likely become sustainable time, turn support better long-term investment opportunities there. Bond issuers looking invest sustainable development regions may benefit mega trend long run. Anthony Xiao client portfolio manager fixed income team Invesco, global investment management company.

Smart contracts already featured crypto tokens, notably Ethereum Virtual Machine (\"ERC-20\") supports developing smart contracts using Solidity programming language, combination Javascript C++. initially cause alarm jurisdictions, blockchain smart contracts hold great potential increasingly well-understood regulators. addition powering telematics behind Insurtech products (for potential telematics China see past article, \"Can Foreign Investors Capitalize Insurtech\\'s Growth China?\"), smart contracts enable automating transfers rights exchange funds lowering transaction costs (especially multi-party agreements). technology forms basis Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICO\"). ICOs, smart contracts allow fundraising venture execute sufficient investors agreed financing terms. exchange funding venture, investors receive token, kind digital share certificate recorded blockchain. Although ICOs provide innovative potentially important vehicle support fundraising new ventures ideas, lack regulation rampant fraud raised serious regulatory concerns became popular years ago. this, see Zetzsche et al., \"The ICO gold rush: scam, bubble, super challenge regulators\", Harvard International Law Journal, vol. 60, no. 2, 2019. ICOs banned PRC Mainland since September 2017 (PBOC, CAC, MIIT, SAIC, CBRC, CSRC, CIRC Announcement Preventing Financial Risks Initial Coin Offerings). ICOs remain restricted PRC, legally regulated Hong Kong Taiwan Security Token Offerings (\"STO\"). STOs combine power ICO stringent regulations securities market. Integrating digital Yuan eventual STO regime would revolutionary couple different ways. First, allowing STOs — whether Hong Kong PRC assuming legalized — denominated DCEP would greatly benefit fundraising innovative space. would win private investors government: investors gain access powerful new fundraising tool, government monitor regulate STOs financial exchanges bringing within fold Chinese securities laws. would allow regulators implement mandatory disclosure rules protect investors risks fraud associated ICOs, displace unofficial cryptocurrencies channeling existing ICO action legitimate STO system. Together, changes would make institutional investors likely treat STOs serious investment opportunities. result, enabling DCEP support STOs would cement DCEP\\'s appeal fundraisers institutional investors helping government keep tabs new activity public exchanges. Legalizing STOs allowing denominated DCEP also opens major new underwriting opportunities property insurers. Say, example, opportunity presents new insurance line business — new Chinese rocket company wants launch missions space replenish International Space Station, launch new satellite. Given risks, cannot find insurer willing underwrite sell insurance policy. DCEP-denominated STO, insurer could decide underwrite policy condition STO attracts adequate number co-insurers reinsurers, exchange tokens financial assets. there\\'s adequate market interest STO listed, policy would launch (as would rocket ship!), divided token shares, distributed insurer reinsurer\\'s book business exchange DCEP payments. STO written, subsequent steps would happen automatically significantly reduce transaction costs. Innovations like already occurring, example Nexus Mutual, blockchain company providing decentralized financial alternative insurance cover. Depending innovative regulators wish be, \"policy tokens\" could resold securities investors Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hong Kong stock exchange. interview Sergey Nazarov, co-founder Chainlink (a company developing \"oracles\" smart contracts), one possibility discussion revenue policies even become tokenized, bought sold fixed-income investment asset. Due instant settlement capability, denominating investments DCEP would also open door participation foreign insurers provided satisfy market access requirements (for this, see past articles, WFOE Shopping — Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen Compare Establishing Insurance WFOE China?; China, GATS, Trump: Non-US Insurers Get Piece China-US Trade Deal?). Second, integrating DCEP STO regime would particularly welcome insurance investors, restrictions equity investments recently relaxed November 2020.

Generally, long equity investment prospect safe, liquid (stable cash flow track record dividends), profitable, legally registered engaged serious legal disputes, led honest team, presents risk related-party transactions, involved real estate, serious environmental polluter, NDRC\\'s negative list, insurer free invest it. Although practice significant number ICOs risky, failed, would meet criteria investment, theory opens door lucrative new investment opportunities government opens door PRC STOs sufficient securities regulations place. DCEP/STO revolution far reality, government already moving towards \"internet blockchains\" would allow DCEP work far better existing smart contract ecosystems.
